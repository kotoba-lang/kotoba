# kotoba

**Content-Addressed Distributed Datalog Database**

```
KOTOBA ≝ Datom[CID/T] × EAVT[KSE Topic] × Pregel[BSP] × Datalog[Δ]
          × CACAO × AT Protocol × LLM/Weight × WASM/WIT
```

Kotoba is a distributed, content-addressed knowledge graph database designed
for decentralized AI agent systems.  It combines Datomic-style immutable
datoms, Pregel BSP graph computation, an auxiliary SPARQL 1.1 executor over IPFS
storage, native CACAO authentication, and WASM Component Model execution.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
# Tap the kotoba formula
brew tap etzhayyim/kotoba          # one-time
brew install kotoba                # installs the `kotoba` binary
```

To track the upstream `main` branch instead of the latest tagged release,
add `--HEAD`:

```bash
brew install --HEAD kotoba
```

Or, install the formula directly from this repo without tapping:

```bash
brew install --build-from-source ./Formula/kotoba.rb
```

### From source (any platform)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etzhayyim/kotoba.git
cd kotoba
cargo install --locked --path crates/kotoba-cli --bin kotoba
```

## Quick start

The full IPFS + CACAO + Datomic/Datalog stack, with SPARQL as an auxiliary
query surface, runs as four single-shot commands:

```bash
# 1. One-time: generate Ed25519 + X25519 + DID, persist to macOS Keychain
#    (or ~/.etzhayyim/kotoba.env on Linux/other, chmod 600).
kotoba init

# 2. Start the server. IPFS cold tier + CACAO Private-default are ON by
#    default.  Add KOTOBA_PEERS="http://p1:5001 http://p2:5001" to fan-out
#    across multi-peer DistributedBlockStore.
kotoba serve &

# 3. Smoke-test: ingest a sample entity and run all four SPARQL forms
#    (SELECT / DESCRIBE / CONSTRUCT / ASK) through the direct-SPARQL endpoint.
kotoba demo

# 4. HTTP loadtest the running server.  `--cacao-seed <hex>` runs the bench
#    through the full CACAO + Private-graph path with fresh nonces per request.
kotoba bench --iters 1000 -c 16 'SELECT * WHERE { ?s <kg/claim/role> "admin" }'
```

Bare CLI features:

```bash
kotoba whoami                                    # print resolved config
kotoba sparql 'ASK { ?s <kg/claim/role> "admin" }'
kotoba sparql 'DESCRIBE <cid:abc...>' --cacao <b64>
kotoba cypher 'MATCH (a)-[r]->(b) RETURN a, b'
kotoba health                                    # ping /health
```

CACAO ecosystem helpers:

```bash
kotoba did-derive <32-byte-hex-seed>             # → did:key:z…
kotoba cacao-sign <seed> --graph <cid> \
    --capability datom:read [--private] [--aud <did>]
```

## Defaults that just work

| Knob                       | Default                                                  | Override                       |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Cold tier                  | `KuboBlockStore` against `KOTOBA_IPFS_ENDPOINT`          | `KOTOBA_IPFS=off`              |
| IPFS endpoint              | `http://localhost:5001`                                  | `KOTOBA_IPFS_ENDPOINT=…`       |
| Multi-peer federation      | none (single-node)                                        | `KOTOBA_PEERS="http://… http://…"` |
| Default graph visibility   | `Private { owner_did = operator_did }` (CACAO required)  | `KOTOBA_DEFAULT_VISIBILITY=authenticated\|public\|private` |
| Agent identity             | macOS Keychain → `~/.etzhayyim/kotoba.env` → env → ephemeral  | `kotoba init`                   |

`kotoba serve` boots with a clear startup probe: if `ipfs daemon` is not
reachable on `KOTOBA_IPFS_ENDPOINT`, you get a single WARN line telling you
exactly how to silence or fix it.

## Properties

- **Content-addressed** — IPFS-compatible CIDv1 sha2-256 over raw / dag-pb / dag-cbor blocks
- **Immutable datoms** — Datomic-style 5-tuple `(E,A,V,T,Added)` with retract tombstones
- **5-index arrangement** — EAVT / AEVT / AVET / VAET / TEA for O(1)–O(log n) access
- **Prolly Tree storage** — deterministic, hash-consistent B-tree over blocks
- **Distributed Pregel** — BSP graph computation across nodes via libp2p
- **AT Protocol native** — Datom projection backed by commit DAG and JetStream
- **WASM runtime** — arbitrary graph logic as Component Model guests
- **E2E encryption** — Signal Protocol + CACAO auth for consent-gated data
- **Datomic/Datalog primary, SPARQL auxiliary** — the distributed Datom DB is the source of truth; SPARQL 1.1 reads the same projection for RDF-compatible query and federation
- **CACAO-native authz** — depth-2 delegation chains, multi-graph grants, anti-replay nonce

## Architecture

The canonical spine is one content-addressed chain — **Datom log → ProllyTree
indexes → CommitDag → blocks** — with IPFS and B2 as export tiers, not the
system of record:

![kotoba Datomic-over-IPFS architecture](docs/kotoba-datomic-architecture.svg)

**① Canonical write path** — `kg.ingest`/`transact` →
`QuadStore::assert_datom` (`kotoba-graph/src/quad_store.rs`) records the exact
5-tuple `Datom{e,a,v,t,added}` in `pending_datoms`; a short window later
`commit()` builds the EAVT/AEVT/AVET/VAET (+ `datom_*` + append-only **TEA**)
**ProllyTrees** (`kotoba-core/src/prolly.rs`) — probabilistic chunking
(`blake3(key)&0xFF==0`) + path-copy so each commit writes only the delta; nodes
are **DAG-CBOR/IPLD** (`Internal [(k, child-CID)]` tag-42 links) addressed by
`sha2-256(dag-cbor) → CIDv1`. Blocks pack into one **CARv1** bundle and a
`Commit{root,index_roots,prev,seq}` block is appended to the **CommitDag**.
**The CommitDag is the write-ahead log** — an immutable, parent-linked,
content-addressed chain whose durability boundary is the atomic head-ref update
(git / Datomic semantics); restart loads the head + checkpoint and walks commits
since, no second-log replay.
> Pruned (per [ADR-2606041151](../../90-docs/adr/2606041151-kotoba-commitdag-as-wal-and-incremental-query-tier.md)):
> the old per-assert **Journal WAL** (4-topic double-write) and **Kubo-as-durable-tier**
> — the CommitDag already is the WAL; the Journal was a redundant double-write and the
> ~30 s startup-replay bottleneck.

**② Query — Datomic first-tier** — the 4-index model is tier-1: BGP routing does
direct index scans (EAVT point lookup ~180 ns, AVET, VAET reverse) over the
ProllyTree, and an incremental **MaterializedView** (`kotoba-kqe/src/mv.rs`,
maintained per commit Δ) serves recurring/Datalog queries without re-evaluating
from scratch. `kg.sparql` (SELECT/ASK/DESCRIBE/CONSTRUCT/UPDATE/SERVICE) is the
auxiliary RDF surface over the same indexes; `db_before`/TEA give Datomic-style
`as-of` time travel. All queries run over the IPFS-backed substrate — the hot
Arrangement is only an optimisation (cache).

**③ Block store — kotoba is its own IPFS block store + pinner** — the durable hot
tier is an embedded, in-process store (direct disk, µs–ms) and kotoba holds pins
itself (a flag in its own store, no `pin/add` RPC), removing the HTTP-RPC hop
(~35× ingest). Sealed commits **export asynchronously**, off the hot path:
**Kubo IPFS** (bitswap + DHT; optionally a networked pin service for the donated
mesh) and an **off-host cold pin to Backblaze B2**
(`50-infra/kotoba-b2-pin`, DataLad + git-annex S3 — mirrors every block,
`restore` re-imports via `ipfs block put`,
[ADR-2606041130](../../90-docs/adr/2606041130-kotoba-b2-blockstore-cold-pin.md)).

**④ Anchors** — the **Datom log is the canonical state**
([ADR-2605312345](../../90-docs/adr/2605312345-kotoba-datom-first-class-canonical-state.md));
IPNS signed heads pin per-graph roots (durable across restart), Base L2 anchors
the commit-DAG root for tamper-evidence, and AT-Proto MST is the ingress/interop
wire that materializes the log.

## Query Surfaces

Primary query/write semantics are Datomic-style Datom APIs and Datalog over
the immutable `(E,A,V,T,Added)` history. SPARQL is intentionally a secondary
RDF-compatible query surface over that Datomic/IPLD head, not a competing
source of truth.

Server endpoint: `POST /xrpc/com.etzhayyim.apps.kotoba.graph.sparql`

Auto-detects the form from the leading keyword and dispatches to the
matching Datom-backed cold-path method:

- `SELECT` — BGP / Filter / Union / Optional / Sub-SELECT / VALUES / GROUP BY / HAVING / ORDER BY / LIMIT / OFFSET / Property paths `+ * ? ^ |` / Sequence
- `DESCRIBE` — explicit IRIs and `?var WHERE { … }` forms; parallel per-subject fetch
- `CONSTRUCT` — template instantiation from any WHERE pattern
- `ASK` — constant-time short-circuit on first match
- `UPDATE` — `INSERT DATA` / `DELETE DATA` / `INSERT/DELETE WHERE`
- `SERVICE <cid:remote-graph>` — federated query across content-addressed graphs

Every form has a CACAO-authed variant — pass `cacaoB64` in the request body.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace                  # ~1184 tests pass
cargo build --release -p kotoba-cli     # final `kotoba` binary
```

## Coverage

```bash
./scripts/coverage.sh        # per-crate + total line/region coverage (lib tests)
./scripts/coverage.sh html   # browsable report at target/llvm-cov/html/index.html
./scripts/coverage.sh lcov   # lcov.info for CI / codecov upload
```

Requires `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov` and a rustup toolchain (the script pins
to `rustup run stable` because Homebrew rust ships no `llvm-tools`).
