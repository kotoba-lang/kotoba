# Kotoba

> **A language AI agents can use, not abuse.**

AI writes freely. Kotoba draws the boundary.

Kotoba is an intuitive, declarative, security-first language and computing
stack for AI agents—and for humans who vibe-code with them.

> **Post-quantum cryptography is not an optional mode. It is the admission
> floor for every new Kotoba cryptographic boundary.**

New confidentiality boundaries require hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM-768; new
publication and package-admission boundaries require ML-DSA-65 alongside the
current classical proof. Unknown suites, stripped PQ material, and
classical-only downgrade fail closed. Development-only legacy paths are not a
compatibility target and do not define the Kotoba security model.

> **Existing software adds security around the program. Kotoba makes security
> a property of the whole computation.**

This repository contains the installable Kotoba CLI and implementation. A
compiled program can use only the authority it was granted: no implicit
filesystem, network, process, clock, model, or secrets. Unsupported or
unverifiable behavior fails closed. This is a confinement direction, not an
“unhackable” claim; runtime and OS isolation remain part of the trusted
computing base.

Language contract:
[`kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang) · site:
[kotoba-lang.org](https://kotoba-lang.org)

```sh
brew tap kotoba-lang/kotoba && brew trust kotoba-lang/kotoba && brew install kotoba
kotoba -e '(+ 1 2)'
```

Web3 identity starts from a chain-neutral Kotoba principal controlled by a
Passkey. EVM smart accounts are explicit CAIP-10 links verified by ERC-1271 or
ERC-6492 when counterfactual; neither Base nor any provider is the identity
root. No private key or seed crosses this CLI boundary, and authentication does
not grant an agent authority without a separately scoped capability.

```sh
kotoba id new
# browser opens → approve with Passkey → verified username + Stable Principal saved locally

kotoba id show

kotoba id new \
  --account eip155:8453:0xA00366234D29d4F882088048c0B2fa0dB7302D4E
```

`auth.kotoba.cloud` is the automatic canonical RP; no username or RP input is
required. The CLI uses a ten-minute, single-use device authorization request. The
Passkey ceremony and browser session remain on `auth.kotoba.cloud`; the CLI
receives only `{username, principalId, accountDid, activeDid}` and stores that
public projection at `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/kotoba/principal.edn`.
It does not mint an unrelated local UUID and never receives a Passkey private
key, wallet seed, browser cookie, or long-lived bearer token. A non-canonical
`--rp-id` is refused before the browser opens.

Base remains a useful Murakumo settlement link, but it appears only when
`eip155:8453` is supplied. `kotoba id account --address 0x… --chain-id 1`
describes a compatibility account alias; it never replaces the principal.

`kotoba identity new` remains an explicit Ed25519 operator-key command for
IPNS namespace and artifact signing. It is not the default human login ID.

An empty policy denies every host effect, including `:host/http`. Hosted billed
deploy of those grants is not live. Wasm Component is the primary portable
profile. Bounded native AOT (x86-64/AArch64) is a supported, explicitly selected
backend; ordinary-application native (ambient OS process) is a non-goal.

The persistent Datalog database is
[`kotoba-lang/kotobase`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase), not this
repository.

The rest of this file is the implementation contract.

## Purpose and philosophy

Kotoba is designed first for software written, changed, tested, and operated by
AI agents and by people directing them. That includes autonomous coding loops
and vibe-coding workflows, where intent may arrive as natural language and the
generated program must still cross a deterministic safety boundary before it
can act. Source, dependencies, checked KIR, target artifacts, tool requests, and
observed external content are treated as untrusted inputs—not as authority.

The priorities are:

1. **Safety before ambient convenience.** Effects, capabilities, resource
   budgets, package identities, and deployment authority are explicit and
   deny-by-default. Unsupported or unverifiable behavior fails closed.
2. **A short, reproducible agent loop.** Machine-readable contracts, one checked
   KIR shared by qualified backends, bounded compiler workers, deterministic
   caches, target-aware tests, and signed receipts make develop → check → test →
   deploy cycles fast to repeat and cheap to audit. Performance claims remain
   workload- and host-specific rather than universal.
3. **Cryptographic trust with precise scope.** CID-pinned inputs, signatures,
   trust/revocation policy, artifact seals, and execution receipts protect
   integrity and provenance. Encryption, decryption, key use, and secret access
   occur only through explicitly granted, purpose-bound capabilities and a
   qualified provider; Kotoba does not claim that every source file or value is
   automatically encrypted.
4. **White-hat use.** The language and its tooling are intended for authorized
   construction, defense, verification, repair, and auditable automation—not
   for bypassing controls or acquiring hidden authority. This philosophy guides
   the project; enforceable safety comes from the capability/effect/resource
   boundary rather than from trusting an agent's stated intent.

### Design influences

These are influences on particular design choices, not claims of source or
runtime compatibility:

- **Lisp and Clojure** — homoiconic, data-oriented programs; immutable values;
  a small composable language; and interactive development.
- **Rust** — compile-time safety discipline and affine handling of authority.
  Kotoba is benchmarked against Rust's safety model; it does not copy Rust's
  general ownership/lifetime system.
- **Deno** — secure-by-default execution with explicit permission boundaries.
- **Unison** — semantic, content-addressed definition identity and codebase
  operations independent of mutable file names.
- **Ethereum and CACAO** — signed identity, attenuated delegation, and
  verifiable authorization/receipt boundaries, without implying EVM
  compatibility.
- **IPFS** — CID-addressed, byte-verified discovery and distribution.
- **Nix** — pinned inputs, declarative environments, reproducible artifacts,
  and the principle that deployment should consume the same admitted closure
  that was tested.

## Stack topology

### Public service domains

[`kotoba.cloud`](https://kotoba.cloud) is the CLI's public control, identity,
and deploy-discovery entrance. It deliberately does not collapse the services
it coordinates:

- [`kotobase.net`](https://kotobase.net) persists artifacts, state, and
  receipts;
- [`murakumo.cloud`](https://murakumo.cloud) places and executes CPU/GPU work;
- [`itonami.cloud`](https://itonami.cloud) carries agent work: workspaces,
  goals, tools, and approvals; and
- [`kotoba-lang.org`](https://kotoba-lang.org) remains the language,
  specification, and conformance surface.

The machine-readable contract is
[`/.well-known/kotoba-cloud.json`](https://kotoba.cloud/.well-known/kotoba-cloud.json).
Discovery is not ambient authority: each deploy receipt records the origins
separately and the CLI refuses a profile whose pinned role assignments drift.

The canonical dependency topology of the stack (compiler at the foundation;
`kotoba` → compiler; `kototama` → `aiueos` ("decides ⊣ enforces") ; `kotobase`
→ `kotoba`, never the reverse; `aiueos` dependency-minimal, consuming compiler
*artifacts*), plus this repo's assigned cleanup items (finishing the
language-authority migration to `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`, and the
`kototama`/`kotodama` · `kotobase*`/`kotoba-client` naming convergence), is
recorded in
[`docs/ADR-stack-topology-and-design-cleanup.md`](docs/ADR-stack-topology-and-design-cleanup.md)
(root authority: `com-junkawasaki/root` ADR-2607241100).

## Repository boundary

`kotoba-lang/kotoba` is the language and library substrate. Keep generic
protocols, data structures, compilers, runtimes, storage, crypto, and reusable
fixtures here. The split policy is recorded in
[`docs/ADR-repository-boundaries.md`](docs/ADR-repository-boundaries.md).

`kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang` owns the standalone language and public CLI contract.
This repository keeps host implementations, integration tests, and legacy Rust
adapters while they are migrated to consume the CLJC/EDN authority there.

The Rust `kotoba` crate/CLI is an integration adapter over multiple workspace
crates. It is no longer the semantic authority for the public CLI. New command
shape belongs in `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`, and host launchers should delegate
to that CLJC contract.

`kami-engine` is the strongest future split candidate when the Kami host,
rendering/devtool SDK, templates, and golden UI verification can build without
`kotoba-kotodama` path dependencies. After that split, this repository should
keep only thin WIT/component fixtures and integration tests for Kami surfaces.

Domain actors do not belong in this repository. They live in
`etzhayyim/com-etzhayyim-*` as `.cljc` actors/cells. AT Protocol actors,
PDS/AppView handlers, and XRPC application surfaces live in
`gftdcojp/app-aozora`. Hosting, placement, fleet, gateway, and runtime
operations live in `kotoba-lang/murakumo`.

The historical `crates/kotoba-kotodama` tree (and the rest of `crates/`) has
since been removed from this repository entirely (`604896171b`, 2026-07-01);
domain cells, Python UDF pools, AT Protocol actors, and hosting code moved to
their canonical owners per the boundary above.

## 📺 Explainers & Docs site

A static documentation site (landing page + **two interactive, auto-playing
explainer videos** with Japanese narration) lives under [`docs/`](docs/) and is
published via GitHub Pages:

> **🌐 [kotoba-lang.github.io/kotoba](https://kotoba-lang.github.io/kotoba/)**

|---|---|
| **Part 1 — [Datomic × IPFS × Prolly Tree](https://kotoba-lang.github.io/kotoba/explainer/kotoba-datomic-ipfs-explainer.html)** | how a Datomic-style query runs over a Prolly-Tree index that is DAG-CBOR/IPLD content-addressed and pinned to IPFS — write → 4-index build → CID → CommitDag → query `scan_prefix` → result provenance CID |
| **Part 2 — [Query / CACAO / Signal](https://kotoba-lang.github.io/kotoba/explainer/kotoba-query-auth-signal-explainer.html)** | complex/large queries (BGP join, MaterializedView), multihop (property paths, Pregel BSP), federation (`SERVICE`), the transact write path, CACAO auth/authz (depth-2 delegation), and Signal E2E (X3DH → Double Ratchet) + t-of-N custody |

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
# Tap the kotoba formula
brew tap kotoba-lang/kotoba        # one-time
brew trust kotoba-lang/kotoba      # Homebrew 6 will not load an untrusted tap
brew install kotoba                # installs the native `kotoba` executable
```

To track the upstream `main` branch instead of the latest tagged release,
add `--HEAD`:

```bash
brew install --HEAD kotoba
```

Or, install the formula directly from this repo without tapping:

```bash
brew install --build-from-source ./Formula/kotoba.rb
```

### From source (any platform)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba.git
cd kotoba
bin/kotoba check --kind cli-contract --json
```

### Shell installer (macOS / Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer verifies the release archive checksum and installs a native
executable. Neither a JVM nor Clojure CLI is required at runtime.

Profile-bound releases are built from a clean commit without GitHub Actions:

```bash
scripts/package-native-release.sh 0.7.3 darwin-arm64 ../kotoba-lang/lang/version-policy.edn
kagi get kotoba-language-release-ed25519 --compartment personal |
  clojure -M:release-tag sign \
    --policy ../kotoba-lang/lang/version-policy.edn \
    --trust ../kotoba-lang/lang/release-trust.edn \
    --envelope target/release-evidence/unsigned-envelope.edn \
    > target/release-evidence/kotoba-v0.7.3-envelope.edn
clojure -M:release-tag verify \
  --policy ../kotoba-lang/lang/version-policy.edn \
  --trust ../kotoba-lang/lang/release-trust.edn \
  --envelope target/release-evidence/kotoba-v0.7.3-envelope.edn
```

The signed envelope binds the implementation commit and tree, source root,
language and package profiles, archive digest, conformance counts, issue time,
and active external signer. Publication must stop if any binding fails.

### npm / npx

An npm compatibility launcher is planned but is not published. Native Homebrew
and shell installs above are the authoritative JVM-free distribution paths; do
not rely on an `@kotoba-lang/kotoba` package until this section names a released
version and registry digest.

### Source-checkout launcher

`bin/kotoba` exposes the same public CLI from a source checkout and delegates
to `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`'s CLJC CLI authority instead of adding independent
command semantics:

```bash
bin/kotoba check --kind cli-contract --json
bin/kotoba deploy --manifest package-manifest.edn --target dev
```

`deploy` against a murakumo target is the Deno-like one-command publish:
checked wasm → IPNS name → murakumo public URL. Default `--dry-run` is
true. `apply` is what publishes. Deno Deploy, Cloudflare, and Vercel are
not targets. Hosted billed deploy of capability grants is not live.

Before planning or applying a Murakumo target, the CLI checks a control-plane
profile. It tries `https://kotoba.cloud/.well-known/kotoba-cloud.json` by
default, or the comma-separated file/HTTPS mirrors in
`KOTOBA_CONTROL_PLANE_PROFILES`. Any fetched profile fails closed unless it
names `auth.kotoba.cloud` as identity, `kotobase.net` as storage,
`api.murakumo.cloud` as compute, and `itonami.cloud` as agent work. If every
mirror is unavailable, deploy continues with the same topology pinned into the
CLI release and records `:kotoba.deploy/control-profile-degraded? true`; an
available but conflicting profile is never hidden by that fallback. Cloudflare
is therefore an optional discovery edge, not an availability dependency of
this direct-to-Murakumo deploy path.
The profile states `hostedApply: false`: admission remains local and compute
placement remains a Murakumo operation until a hosted apply API is implemented
and qualified.

```bash
# safe first step — prints the URL apply would publish, writes nothing
bin/kotoba deploy --manifest package-manifest.edn --target murakumo:asher

# one local identity — prints did:key + ipns-name, never the seed
bin/kotoba identity new

# Optional: independent mirrors, or no HTTPS gateway projection at all.
export KOTOBA_CONTROL_PLANE_PROFILES="file:/etc/kotoba/control-plane.json,https://control.example.net/kotoba.json"
export KOTOBA_IPNS_GATEWAYS="https://gw1.example.net,https://gw2.example.net"
# export KOTOBA_IPNS_GATEWAYS=ipns-only

# Two independently readable desired-state mirrors; quorum defaults to all.
export KOTOBA_DESIRED_MIRRORS="ssh://asher/var/lib/kekkai/desired,ssh://judah/var/lib/kekkai/desired"
# Optional explicit authority path (default: ~/.kotoba/desired-authority.edn)
export KOTOBA_DESIRED_AUTHORITY="$PWD/.kotoba/desired-authority.edn"

# publish the admitted wasm and signed Murakumo desired state
bin/kotoba deploy apply \
  --manifest package-manifest.edn \
  --target murakumo:asher \
  --dry-run false \
  --release-evidence release-evidence.edn \
  --component target/app.wasm
```

Successful apply prints EDN whose `:kotoba.cli/message` is

```
published https://murakumo.cloud/ipns/k51…
```

The receipt always carries the canonical `ipns://k51…` name and immutable
`ipfs://<component-cid>`. HTTPS gateway URLs are replaceable projections; with
`KOTOBA_IPNS_GATEWAYS=ipns-only`, the CLI prints the IPNS name and does not
claim an HTTPS publication surface.

The receipt carries `:kotoba.deploy/ipns-url` (`ipns://k51…`),
`:kotoba.deploy/ipfs-url` (`ipfs://<component-cid>`), and all configured HTTPS
projections in `:kotoba.deploy/gateway-urls`. Unless IPNS-only mode is selected,
the first projection is also `:kotoba.deploy/public-url`. The IPNS name is
the existing `kotoba codebase publish --ipns` stack
(`kotoba.codebase-ipns/publish-cid!`), not a second naming system.
Compute reside publishes a signed Kekkai envelope identified by CIDv1, with a
monotonic epoch and previous-CID chain, to `KOTOBA_DESIRED_MIRRORS`. Murakumo
nodes pull and verify this desired state against the pinned authority. No
Cloudflare service, sibling Murakumo checkout, or `clojure` subprocess is in
the deploy path. If the mirror quorum is not reached, apply fails closed and
does not write a success receipt.

Operator of the public host: 運営元 [awai.network](https://awai.network),
営業 Ryo Awai.

Side-effecting commands return EDN/JSON data for host adapters. They do not
invent independent Rust behavior. There is no Rust code or `crates/` tree left
in this repository (removed `604896171b`, 2026-07-01) — the CLJC launcher
above is the only current install path.

## Quick start

The CLI command surface is versioned and machine-readable in
[`kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`'s `lang/cli.edn`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang/blob/main/lang/cli.edn)
(the semantic authority — see [Repository boundary](#repository-boundary)).
Commands this repo's launcher currently wires up:

`package add` fails closed without `--catalog-cid`. The pinned catalog binds
the release, the classical publisher DID, the ML-DSA-65 key fingerprint, and a
content-addressed `Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65` attestation. Both signature halves and
the identical attestation bytes are verified at every configured origin before
the lock is written. Classical-only package records remain inspectable as
historical data but are not installable through this path.

`library` is the human-facing publication workflow over this existing
hash-native codebase; it is not a second registry. `inspect` returns the signed
release-head CID, definition CIDs, exact dependency CID edges, identity layer,
and optional GitHub provenance. Names, versions and GitHub locations remain
discovery/provenance. They do not replace CIDs or authorize publication.

`library publish` is safe by default: without `--dry-run false` it performs no
network write. Explicit apply builds an immutable `kotoba.library-release.v1`
root. It links the exact namespace head, every selected definition, raw Wasm
artifact, compile receipt, compiler contract, policy, and package-lock
evidence. Missing linked bytes fail publication. The signed namespace record
binds both the namespace head and release root, then IPNS names that signed
record.

Hosted publication adds an application-layer post-quantum approval. The CLI
signs the exact publication request with ML-DSA-65 from `--pqc-seed-file`;
kotoba.cloud requires both a live Passkey session and that signature, then
atomically pins the ML-DSA key to the Stable Principal. This does not change
the algorithm inside the platform authenticator and does not make WebAuthn,
TLS, or the legacy IPNS signature post-quantum.
Publication request schema v3 also signs a random single-use request ID,
issuance/expiry timestamps, and a monotonic `--pqc-key-epoch` (default `1`).
Kotoba Cloud atomically consumes that ID; replay, expiry, or an old epoch is a
hard failure before the Kotobase relay.

`pq-key rotate` signs one short-lived transition payload with both the current
and next ML-DSA-65 keys; `pq-key revoke` signs it with the current key. Neither
command sends a seed. Each returns a fragment-only kotoba.cloud URL, where the
same Principal must explicitly confirm with Passkey. Rotation increments the
key epoch atomically, revocation fails future publication closed, and exact
transition IDs cannot be replayed. Independent recovery quorum and an
externally witnessed transparency log remain separate, not-yet-live gates.

`kotoba crypto` provides a separate fail-closed data-encryption envelope. It
combines X25519 and ML-KEM-768 and uses the transcript-bound hybrid secret with
AES-256-GCM. Missing either KEM half, an unknown suite, header changes, or
ciphertext changes are rejected; there is no classical-only fallback.

These are instances of the repository-wide default: a newly introduced
cryptographic boundary is not admitted until it has a named post-quantum suite,
downgrade rejection, and verification evidence. Classical algorithms may
remain as one half of a hybrid construction; they are not sufficient alone for
new protected paths.

Applied publication requires at least two distinct provider IDs and endpoints.
It returns `published-pending-availability`, not “distributed”, until
`library verify` re-fetches every DAG-CBOR and raw block from every provider,
verifies each CID, and observes the configured provider quorum through an
independent delegated router. Only then is a content-addressed availability
proof emitted. `library run` applies the same availability gate before loading
the receipt-bound Wasm artifact and executing its hashed export.

`--typed` selects the identity layer. Without it a definition is hashed from
the surface IR the codebase normalizes for itself; with it the identity is the
**checked KIR** the compiler produces and the backends consume, binding the
typed interface (parameter types, result, declared effects) alongside the body.
Prefer `--typed` for anything that will also be compiled: it is what makes
`kotoba codebase run f` and `kotoba compile` the same definition rather than two
that happen to agree. `run` reads which layer a definition belongs to from its
block, so the flag is only needed when writing.

`codebase eval` is the strict public evaluation path. It refuses the legacy
surface-IR identity layer, resolves a human name or hash abbreviation to a
DefCID before admission, and binds the checked interface, complete effect row,
allowed effects, fuel, and nested-eval depth into an AdmissionCID. Successful
typed output is stored as a ValueCID. `(eval request)` in Kotoba source reaches
the same mechanism through typed capability 30 (`:code/eval`) and a bounded
`:document`; it never accepts source text or a host namespace. `apply` remains
ordinary bounded application of an already checked closure. A DefCID identifies
code, an AdmissionCID records authority and limits, and a ValueCID records the
result—none substitutes for either of the other two.

`compile` starts from a CID, not a file: the closure is hydrated into one KIR
module whose functions are named by their own hashes, and the backend consumes
it exactly as it consumes one lowered from source. The build cache is keyed on
the definition graph — code closure, compiler contract, target ABI, package
lock, policy — so a hit is safe across machines, checkouts and namespaces, and
renaming a definition invalidates nothing. An **effectful** definition is never
cached: reuse means "the answer is the same", which no call to the outside world
can promise. Every compilation writes an execution receipt binding what it
depended on.

`--module-lock` is where the two content-addressed halves meet. The lock pins
*which bytes were compiled*; `typed-code` hashes *what they mean*. Neither
implies the other, and an update authored this way carries the `lock-cid` of the
exact input set it came from.

`codebase` is hash-native: `run` and `view` read the stored definition and
hydrate its dependencies BY CID, so a definition runs with no source file, no
namespace, and no name — and a name, a full CID, and a `#`-abbreviation are
interchangeable ways of saying one. `add` propagates an update by rewriting each
dependent's dependency CID, which is why a dependent that was authored in a
scratch buffer you no longer have still moves forward.

`pull` asks the IPFS delegated-routing HTTP API who provides a CID and fetches
raw blocks from trustless gateways. Every byte is verified against the CID that
was requested before it is persisted, so a router that lies and a gateway that
serves the wrong bytes are both merely unhelpful.

`serve` / `publish` / `follow` are the other half. A publishing node is a
trustless gateway (`GET /ipfs/{cid}?format=raw`, the same interface the public
network speaks) plus a follower that also serves. For a friendly namespace, the
host admits the first push only when `--namespace-owners` names that namespace's
expected DID in an EDN map such as `{"team/app" "did:key:z…"}`. A valid
self-signature proves key control, not entitlement to a chosen name. Once
admitted, the host persists and pins that publisher and applies the same
signature, sequence and chain checks a private follower does. A namespace head
is the one mutable claim in the system, so it is signed — the record carries a
monotonic sequence and links its predecessor, and a follower pins the key on
first follow. Missing or malformed initial-owner policy fails closed. Serving
grants nobody anything: the host verifies every pushed block against its CID,
and the follower verifies everything again, which is why the record is signed
rather than the connection trusted.

Mutating block and head requests also require an operator write authority.
`--write-authorities-file` loads a bounded EDN policy such as
`{"agent-a" {:current "new-secret" :previous ["old-secret"]}}`; the overlap
supports staged rotation, and removing the previous token revokes it. A token
cannot name two principals. The older `--write-token-file` remains as one
`legacy` principal. Starting `serve` without either option is safe and
read-only; public GET, browse and follow remain available.

Authenticated unique block ingress is bounded by a durable node-wide byte quota
(256 MiB by default, configurable with `--max-upload-bytes`) and a durable
per-principal quota (`--max-principal-upload-bytes`, aggregate-equivalent by
default). Block and head mutations also share a durable per-principal request
budget, configured by `--max-write-requests` and `--write-rate-window-ms`.
Balances survive restart and concurrent server processes; duplicate CIDs spend
request rate but no additional byte quota. The CLI sends write authority only
to HTTPS or an explicit loopback HTTP endpoint; loopback writes are direct and
redirects are disabled. This is an admission/DoS boundary, separate from CID
integrity and namespace publisher authorization. Distributed quota,
retention/GC and measured abuse soak remain operational work.

A serving node also browses: `/browse/{namespace}` lists what each name
currently selects and `/def/{cid}` renders the stored definition with its
dependencies and dependents as links. Every link is a hash, so following one
navigates the actual graph rather than a site-shaped copy of it.

`diff` asks the questions the CIDs make answerable: was a definition *authored*
or did it only move because a dependency moved; was it *renamed* (identical CID,
different name); did the *interface* change or only the body. `rebase` replays
what a branch authored onto a new base and re-derives what it merely carried.
Conflicts come back as data and are never resolved by guessing.

`publish --ipns` names the head in the **real DHT**. `io-libp2p-specs-kad-dht`
speaks `/routing/v1` with multi-router quorum and `tech-ipfs-specs-ipns`
produces the record any IPFS implementation validates, so publishing through a
delegated router — which *is* a DHT node — writes the same record at the same
DHT key a Kubo node would. Verified against `delegated-ipfs.dev`: published and
resolved back, record CID matching.

An IPNS name is derived from the publisher's public key, which removes two
things at once: there is **no registry** (`k51…` *is* the key) and **no key
distribution** (a follower that knows the name knows the key). `follow-name`
therefore takes no `--publisher` argument, and the endpoint is only where blocks
are fetched from. If `publish --ipns` also pushes the friendly namespace to an
HTTP host, that host still requires its local namespace-owner policy; IPNS does
not silently grant a second, human-readable name.

This process is still **not a DHT node** — it holds no routing table and answers
nobody's queries. `announce` remains for asking a pinning service to provide
block bytes, which is a different problem from naming.

The codebase's own signed head record is not replaced by the IPNS record: IPNS
says which head is current, and the head record carries the sequence and
predecessor link that make a rollback detectable. Two signatures over two
different claims, both checked.

Local identity is one command. `kotoba identity new` writes a 32-byte Ed25519
seed to the shared file

```
${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/kotoba/operator.seed
```

at mode 0600 and prints only `did:key` + the IPNS name. A second generate
without `--force` refuses to overwrite. `KOTOBA_CODEBASE_SEED` still overrides
the file when set. The seed is never echoed. `kotoba codebase identity` and
`kotoba deploy` read the same seed, so a developer does not export two env
names. Murakumo should treat this path as the `MURAKUMO_OPERATOR_SEED`
fallback (sibling PR). Announcing to the IPFS DHT still needs a libp2p node,
so a namespace is reachable at the nodes that host it rather than from the
public network (see
[`docs/ADR-kotoba-content-addressed-codebase-gap.md`](docs/ADR-kotoba-content-addressed-codebase-gap.md)).

Multi-module projects use an explicit closed manifest; the compiler never scans
the filesystem or delegates module lookup to JavaScript:

```clojure
{:kotoba.project/root example.app
 :kotoba.project/modules
 {example.app "src/example/app.kotoba"
  example.text "src/example/text.kotoba"}
 :kotoba.project/package-lock "kotoba.lock.edn"
 :kotoba.project/trust "kotoba.trust.edn"
 :kotoba.project/dependency-manifests
 {"kotoba-lang/text" "deps/text/package.edn"}}
```

Module paths must be relative `.kotoba` files contained beneath the manifest
directory. Source namespaces use alias-only dependencies such as
`(:require [example.text :as text])`. Missing/private imports, cycles, path
escape, `:refer`, and undeclared runtime loading fail before KIR emission. The
output manifest includes the exact SHA-256 of every reachable source and the
canonical module-graph digest. Project check/compile additionally require a
package lock and trust policy. Every locked dependency requires one signed,
CID-valid manifest whose name, version, repository identity, commit, tree CID,
manifest CID, capabilities, and exact signer set match its lock entry. Signers
must be explicitly allowlisted by the trust policy. The package-lock, trust-
policy, and deterministic verification-receipt SHA-256 identities are frozen
into both generated ESM and its sidecar; partial supply-chain metadata cannot
reach emission. A dependency-free project still declares an empty versioned
lock, an explicit trust file, and an empty dependency-manifest map.

`--package-lock` is mandatory for `wasm emit`, `wasm run`, and `cljs emit`: the
package admission gate always runs first, and a missing or rejected lock aborts
the build/run with the admission receipt in the error payload — there is no way
to opt out (F-001).

### `kbb` — deny-by-default Kotoba scripts

`bin/kbb` is the first executable replacement slice for nbb-hosted operational
scripts. It accepts one `.kotoba` file and an explicit policy:

```bash
bin/kbb src/demo_kbb_fs_report.kotoba \
  --policy src/demo_kbb_fs_report_policy.edn --json
```

The v1 boundary is intentionally small. The policy must set
`:kotoba.policy/forbid-wildcard true`; only exact resource-scoped
`:fs/app-data` is hosted. `.clj`, `.cljc`, `.cljs`, inline eval, reader-target
overrides, script arguments, unscoped filesystem access, and capabilities with
no real kbb provider fail before execution. Every host call still crosses the
ordinary static capability/effect gate and produces the ordinary receipt.

This first command uses the JVM launcher as an explicitly named
`:bootstrap-jvm` host. It does not load nbb or ClojureScript, and this repo no
longer declares `org.clojure/clojurescript`; it is not yet a self-hosted native
kbb. Process, git, named-secret, and deploy capabilities must be added one
vertical slice at a time with real providers and denial tests before their nbb
consumers move.

#### `kbb --backend js` — the JVM-free JS host, and the kbb library

`bin/kbb_js.cljs` runs the same `.kotoba` + policy through the compiler's
JS route and Node instead of the JVM interpreter (superproject
ADR-2609062200; `amu compile --target js --jvm-free`, amu ADR 0340). Cold
start is sub-second where `bin/kbb` is ~10 s, and it is the second oracle
beside `--backend native`: the same script and policy answer the same number
on both (demo_kbb_fs_read_native → 84).

```bash
bin/kbb src/demo_kbb_fs_read_native.kotoba --policy src/demo_kbb_fs_read_native_policy.edn --backend js   # via the v2 shim
nbb bin/kbb_js.cljs src/demo_kbb_fs_read_native.kotoba   --policy src/demo_kbb_fs_read_native_policy.edn --json
nbb bin/kbb_js.cljs examples/kbb/fs_report.kotoba   --policy examples/kbb/fs_report_policy.edn --source-path lib
```

Providers are keyed by compiler wire id and re-check the policy scope on every
call: `35 :fs/app-data` (read one file inside the realpath'd scope), `33
:env/read` (a granted name; unset answers `""`), `34 :fs/browse` (sorted entry
names of one scoped directory, `"\n"`-joined), `20 :proc/exec` (one policy
invocation by grant index; exit status). `:data/json`, `:data/edn` and
`:http/fetch` have no compiler wire id, so the host refuses them by name and
points at the interpreter backend — never a silent fallback. Every refusal is
a receipt with `:outcome :denied`. (EDN *values* need no capability at all:
`kbb.edn` parses the bytes `kbb.fs` reads — `examples/kbb/edn_value_read.kotoba`
→ 6272 on the JVM-free route.)

`lib/kbb/` is the library scripts write against — `kbb.fs/read-file`,
`kbb.fs/write-file`, `kbb.env/read`, `kbb.browse/entries`, `kbb.proc/exec` and
friends — so a script never spells a `typed-cap-call` or a wire id. Wire 35
now writes as well as reads: the request `"<path>WRITE_SEP<content>"` (an
ASCII token, because Kotoba source cannot emit a control character) is the
form the native loader takes too (amu `6cca3852`), a second `WRITE_SEP` in
the request is refused, and the result is the content written back, so
`kbb.fs/write-ok?` is a `string=?` against what was sent
(`examples/kbb/fs_roundtrip.kotoba` → 20; refusals measured in
`test/kotoba/kbb_js_write_test.clj`). It is consumed through the
project route (`--source-path lib`) and compiles on the js and native
backends alike; `kbb.browse` and `kbb.proc` run on js today because the native
loader's wire-34/20 providers are still stubs (ADR-2609051100 task 5). amu is
located through `$AMU_HOME` or this repo's `deps.edn` pin under `~/.gitlibs`,
and a checkout without `node_modules/nbb` is a named refusal.
`test/kotoba/kbb_js_test.clj` drives the host as a process and SKIPS visibly
when `nbb` or amu is missing. `examples/kbb/no_bb_scan.kotoba` is the first
gate script ported to the compile route (ADR-2607181900 item ②): the test
measures it and the interpreter twin `src/no_bb_scan.kotoba` in one place
(both 3); `examples/kbb/shebang_scan.kotoba` is the second (the interpreter's
`[1 2 2]` packed as 122). `kbb.str` (`starts-with?` / `ends-with?` / `line-count` / `nth-line` /
`count-matches`, all byte-addressed, no capability) is what the ported scans
walk their listings with; `examples/kbb/env_scan.kotoba` takes its directory
from `KBB_SCAN_DIR` through `kbb.env` and is measured in
`test/kotoba/kbb_lib_test.clj` (dirty_dir 3, clean_dir 0, unset → browse denied).
Every `examples/kbb/*.kotoba` script and probe, with its measured answer and
the test that asserts it, is indexed in `docs/DEMONSTRATIONS.md` § kbb.

`cljs emit` currently compiles a NARROW backend slice of `.kotoba` (arithmetic/comparison/
boolean forms, `pair`, map `get`/`assoc` — the ops ADR-2607150000's
narrow-slice governor ports actually use) to plain ClojureScript source text,
not a WASM binary — a second execution target alongside `wasm`, added in
ADR-2607151500 addendum 6. It is now a deprecated compatibility output, not the
safe scripting path. There is no `cljs run`: the emitted source is meant
to be `require`d by a real cljs host (nbb, a browser bundle, Node), not
executed in-process by this JVM launcher. i64/f32/bitwise/string/memory/
capability ops are valid `.kotoba` (and pass the same `check` gate `wasm emit`
uses) but are rejected by `cljs emit` specifically — see `kotoba.runtime/
compile-cljs-expr`'s docstring for the exact scope.

That backend limitation is not the language's application-scope ceiling.
Kotoba defines a safe **Application Profile** for host orchestration, UI, LLM
workflows, explicit state machines, and actors. Observable effects go through
typed, deny-by-default capabilities; the profile does not admit ambient
DOM/SDK/network/filesystem access or process-global mutation. See
[`docs/lang/application-profile.md`](docs/lang/application-profile.md). A
capability family is documented as implemented only after its compiler,
provider, denial, quota/audit, and cross-runtime conformance gates pass.

Looking for things to run? [`docs/DEMONSTRATIONS.md`](docs/DEMONSTRATIONS.md)
indexes every real program built with `.kotoba` so far — the mesh apps, the
**kami-survivors game**, and the capability demos under `src/`, the browser-
and kototama-hosted tools, and the kami-lineage games — with the host that
executes each one.

`graph` / `git` / `rad` / `deploy` are host adapters over the same CLI contract.
`git` and `rad` shell or re-dispatch; `graph` runs Datomic-shaped
connect/query/transact/pull/status on the language EAVT store (`kgraph`);
`deploy` plans and applies a package receipt to a named local target or a
murakumo fleet reside target (default `--dry-run`). Murakumo `apply`
names the admitted wasm in IPNS and prints
`https://murakumo.cloud/ipns/<name>`. Deno Deploy and Cloudflare are not
targets. `hinshitsu` is still a planned contract surface. Consult
`lang/cli.edn` for option shape. Contract delta (this repo only, not yet in
the kotoba-lang pin): launcher-owned `identity` / `identity new [--force]`.
Propose that command to `lang/cli.edn`; until the authority pin moves, this
launcher intercepts `identity` the same way it intercepts `codebase`. No
Deno, Cloudflare, or Vercel targets were added.

## Language — kotoba-lang & kotoba wasm

### `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang` — the language contract

The language itself is not defined in this repository. **[`kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang)**
("Kotoba language design, source profile, and conformance contract") is the
semantic authority — see [Repository boundary](#repository-boundary) above.
This repo hosts launchers and adapters that consume that contract; it does
not define new command shape or language semantics of its own, except the
launcher-owned `identity` / `identity new` local-seed command documented
above (contract delta vs the current `lang/cli.edn` pin).

- **Not a Clojure superset or dialect in the full sense — a Clojure-family
  *profile/subset*** with its own compatibility contract. Primary source
  extensions are `.kotoba`, `.cljk` (CLJ Kotoba), and portable `.cljc`.
  `.clj` and `.cljs` retain their standard Clojure and ClojureScript meanings.
  Web `.kotoba` is compiled through checked KIR and `kotoba-script`; it is not
  delegated to ClojureScript.
- **The CLI/command contract is EDN, not code.** `lang/cli.edn`
  (`:kotoba.cli.contract`, versioned M0–M3) and `lang/adapters.edn` (scopes
  which repos may host adapters) define the command surface; `lang/profile.edn`
  is the machine-readable profile spec. `src/kotoba/cli.cljc` validates the
  contract and shapes argv as EDN — host launchers (like this repo's
  `bin/kotoba-clj`) adapt to this contract; they don't define protocol
  semantics of their own.
- **Compilation targets include WebAssembly, native machine code, and restricted
  Web/JavaScript.** The portable application surface includes
  `kotoba compile --target web|wasm` and `kotoba wasm ...`.
  `compile --target web --run` instantiates js-kotoba-v1 via Node
  `instantiateKotoba` (capability 7 / clock hosted; other kit ids refused).
  `compile --target wasm --run` and `wasm run <file.wasm>` of a `kotoba:cap`
  guest use kototama.tender. Source `.kotoba` `wasm run` stays on
  `wasm-exec`. Kit `:wasm-aot` stays pending. The launcher and kbb v1 bootstrap
  host are still JVM; `bin/kbb` exists but is not yet a self-hosted native
  executable.
  `kotoba -e '(+ 1 2)'` is compile-and-run
  sugar (wraps the expression as an exported `main`, compiles Kotoba → core
  Wasm, runs it) — not a runtime `eval`. Amu additionally emits sealed KEXE
  artifacts for x86-64 and AArch64 and executes admitted, signed artifacts
  through `tender-native`; see [Native compilation and execution](#native-compilation-and-execution).
- **Safety model — "safe Kotoba."** Three formal soundness goals: **T1
  Memory Safety**, **T2 Effect Soundness** (`Γ ⊢ e : T ! E`), **T3 Capability
  Confinement** (a compile-time analog of CACAO delegation attenuation).
  Capabilities are explicit, scoped, typed *values* (`GraphReadCap`,
  `GraphWriteCap`, `InferCap`, `EgressCap`, `SecretReadCap`, `ClockCap`,
  `RandomCap`) — never ambient strings a module can summon by name. Design
  ranking from the language repo's own ADR: capability-sandboxed +
  deny-by-default + reproducible builds (Kotoba's target) ranks above
  Rust-style ownership/borrow Wasm, which ranks above "Clojure syntax + safe
  subset + borrow checker," which ranks above linter-only Clojure/
  ClojureScript.
- **Conformance, not vibes.** `lang/conformance/`, `lang/capability-conformance/`,
  and `lang/package-conformance/` hold positive/negative EDN fixtures run by
  a manifest-driven conformance suite, tracked on an M0–M6 maturity scale
  (`docs/lang/coverage.edn`), with its own versioning policy
  (`docs/lang/versioning.md`) and CI gates (`docs/lang/gates.md`).
- **Package/lock contract.** `lang/package.edn` — CID-pinned packages,
  RID+signature authority, no capability grant without an explicit lockfile
  + policy (this repo's [`docs/ADR-kotoba-package-cid-lock.md`](docs/ADR-kotoba-package-cid-lock.md)).
  Wire protocol: Transit JSON (`ADR-kotoba-transit-wire-protocol.md` in the
  `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang` sibling repo).
- **Where "authority" stops.** `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang` owns the *semantic
  contract* (what the language and CLI mean), not every implementation.
  Capability *value-passing* (typed cap params, `cap-acquire`, i64 ABI
  threading) is implemented in this sibling repo's CLJ runtime, not in
  `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang` itself — the contract repo defines the shape
  (`docs/lang/capability-values.md` in `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`), hosts
  implement it.

### Current memory-safety position

Current Kotoba is **strongly host-contained but not yet a Rust-equivalent
ownership/borrow proof**. The safe Wasm profile combines a checked subset,
Wasm linear-memory bounds and a policy-derived maximum, bounds-respecting
accessors, deny-by-default raw dereference and a no-free bump allocator. The
opt-in `{:kotoba/raw-memory :checked-extents}` profile additionally requires
each raw access to retain allocation provenance and fit its static extent.
This makes use-after-free and double-free structurally absent in the current
guest, while the Wasm boundary keeps guest addresses out of JVM/process memory.

The overall rating is **strong but incomplete**: six helper-heavy wire-protocol
providers still use the explicit raw-memory compatibility hatch. Three
provider consumers use lexical checked allocation extents, and four
PostgreSQL consumers now use caller-proven private slice contracts with
trap-checked dynamic access. The reset, portal and batch paths also prove write
authority for their parameter buffers; portal and batch parsers reject
incomplete frames;
the JVM reference host now binds non-empty output buffers to exact
compiler-created allocation starts
and recorded extents, but external host implementations have not demonstrated
that parity; and guest allocation is monotonic with no per-object reclamation.
Capability confinement is a separate safety axis and must not be used to
overstate heap-integrity guarantees.

See
[`docs/ADR-kotoba-memory-safety-comparison.md`](docs/ADR-kotoba-memory-safety-comparison.md)
for the decision, comparison table, evidence and open gaps, and
[`docs/ADR-kotoba-memory-safety-comparison.edn`](docs/ADR-kotoba-memory-safety-comparison.edn)
for the machine-readable assessment.

The rest of this section (below) walks through the **historical Rust
implementation** of this same design (`kotoba-clj`, `policy.rs`/`subset.rs`/
`effects.rs`). That Rust workspace was removed from this repository
(`604896171b`, 2026-07-01) — the file paths below are a historical record
(see git history), not current source. The CLJC-native successor is tracked
in [ADR-2607022600](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2607022600-kotoba-database-crates-cljc-migration-roadmap.md)
(database side) and, on the language/compiler side, lives in
[`kotoba-lang/amu`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/amu) — **not**
`kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`, which owns the source-extension/CLI/package
*contract* only and does not itself implement compile-time admission gates.
`kotoba-lang/amu`'s `forbidden-heads`/`cap-call`/`infer-effects` in
`src/kotoba/compiler/frontend.clj` are the CLJC counterparts of
`subset.rs`/`policy.rs`/`effects.rs` below; that repo's admitted grammar is
a stricter, capability/effect-gated KIR-level subset that has not yet been
reconciled with this repo's friendlier surface grammar (documented above) —
see `com-junkawasaki/root` ADR-2607141600 for the cross-repo analysis.

## 言語性（Language-ness）

`kotoba` の言語性は、単なる「シンタックス定義」ではなく、次の3点で成立しています。

1. **言語契約の明示化**  
   `.kotoba` が正規ソース契約、`.clj/.cljc/.cljs` が互換入力という優先順位付きの入力面を持つ。  
   `#?(:kotoba ...)` と名前空間解決ルールで、Rust 実装に依存しない公開仕様として運用します。

2. **コンパイルの主権移譲**  
   `kotoba wasm` / `kotoba -e` は `kotoba-lang` の言語面をコンパイラ API として明示し、最終的に

kotoba is not only a database — it ships its **own language profile**.
[`kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang) defines the source contract: `.kotoba` is
the canonical Kotoba source extension, portable `.cljc` is for shared
Clojure-family source, `.clj` / `.cljs` are compatibility inputs, and
`#?(:kotoba ...)` selects Kotoba-specific code.
`kotoba wasm` compiles that profile's Kotoba/EDN subset directly to **real
WebAssembly**: the Kotoba source *becomes* a WASM Component that runs on
`kotoba-runtime` against the `kotoba:kais` host world (graph read/write,
streams, LLM inference, CACAO). `.clj` / `.cljc` / `.cljs` remain compatibility
inputs, but `.kotoba` is the canonical source extension. It is a compiler, not
an embedded interpreter.

The public CLI path is `kotoba wasm`: it exposes build, safe-build, safe-policy,
and selfhost inspection over the same compiler APIs without making callers speak
the implementation crate name. The language gate also pins that public surface:
`kotoba -e`, `kotoba wasm build`, `safe-policy`, `selfhost-inspect`, and
`safe-build` all default to the `kotoba` reader target, accept `-S` /
`--source-path`, and keep `.kotoba` namespace sources ahead of `.clj`
compatibility files. On top of the compiler, **safe Kotoba**
(`compile_safe_kotoba`, legacy alias `compile_safe_clj`) is a *capability-confined*
profile for running untrusted / AI-generated code. The thesis (see
[`docs/ADR-safe-capability-language.md`](docs/ADR-safe-capability-language.md)):
the strongest safety is not a "strong language" but **an execution environment
where an attacker can do nothing it was not explicitly handed**. safe Kotoba
enforces that with three deny-by-default gates, all at compile time:

| Gate | Guarantee | Theorem |
|---|---|---|
| **Capability** (`policy.rs`) | a module's wasm import section ⊆ the policy's grants — an ungranted host capability is *physically absent* from the emitted bytes, so the runtime can never bind it | **T3 — Capability Confinement** |
| **Subset** (`subset.rs`) | no `eval`, no runtime `require`/`import`, no dynamic-var mutation (`set!`/`binding`), no reflection, no unrestricted `defmacro` — constructs the legacy path silently drops are rejected | no ambient code/effect |
| **Effect** (`effects.rs`) | a function may not perform an effect outside its declared `{:effects …}` row — checked **interprocedurally** (a write cannot hide behind a helper; mutual recursion converges) | **T2 — Effect Soundness** |

Capabilities are passed as **values**, never summoned by name: a module not
handed write access to a graph cannot write it — the same attenuation CACAO
enforces at run time, lifted into the type/compile layer. The policy is
deny-by-default EDN (`crates/kotoba-clj/examples/safe-policy.edn`):

```edn
{:imports {:graph-read ["bafy…"] :graph-write ["bafy…"] :infer [] :auth false}
 :limits  {:memory-pages 4 :fuel 1000000 :max-output-bytes 65536}}
```

Build a confined module from the CLI — and audit exactly what it can do:

```bash
kotoba -e '(+ 1 2)'                         # compile Kotoba -> Wasm -> run main
kotoba wasm safe-build cell.kotoba --policy policy.edn -o cell.wasm
# [wasm safe-build] cell.kotoba (10405 bytes)
# [wasm safe-build] admission gate: selfhost/kotoba
# [wasm safe-build] capability surface: kotoba:kais/kqe@0.1.0
# [wasm safe-build] inferred effects: run={graph-write}
```

`--selfhost-gate` is retained only as a compatibility alias; safe-build and
safe-policy are selfhost-first by default.

To inspect the versioned analyzer request and selfhost summaries without
compiling, use:

```bash
kotoba wasm selfhost-inspect cell.kotoba --policy policy.edn --request-hex --json
# {
#   "abi": "kotoba.selfhost.safe-analyzer.v1",
#   "types": {"ok": true, "denials": []},
#   "admission": {"effects": {"ok": true}, "policy": {"ok": true}},
#   "functions": [{"name": "run", "effects": ["graph-write"]}]
# }
```

Capabilities are scoped **per resource**: granting write to graph A does not
permit graph B, and granting inference on model M does not permit model N — the
compile-time twin of CACAO's `leaf.graph ⊆ root.graph` attenuation (T3 at
instance granularity). `kotoba wasm safe-policy <cell>` runs the inverse of the
gate, synthesizing the **minimal least-privilege policy** a cell needs.

Audit/tooling APIs, usable standalone: `embedded_capability_ifaces(wasm)`
(byte-level capability surface), `infer_effects(src)` (source-level transitive
effects), `minimal_policy(src)` (least-privilege synthesis), `Policy::to_edn`.

**Self-hosting today is data-contract sharing, not a Kotoba-authored analyzer.**
The old Rust `crates/kotoba-clj/selfhost/` implementation described in earlier
revisions of this README no longer exists — the whole `crates/` Rust workspace
was removed in `604896171b` (2026-07-01; see
[`docs/ADR-kotoba-wasm-clj-execution.md`](docs/ADR-kotoba-wasm-clj-execution.md)).
What self-hosting means in the current (post-Rust-removal) tree: a shared,
versioned EDN admission contract,
[`kotoba-lang/kotoba-selfhost-contracts`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba-selfhost-contracts)
(pinned in `deps.edn`), ships "seed" data such as `safe_analyzer_facts.edn` —
the classification/effect/capability facts a safe-analyzer implementation
must agree with. This launcher loads and validates those seeds through
`kotoba.selfhost.contracts` (required from `src/kotoba/launcher.clj`) and
exposes them over the CLI as `kotoba selfhost list` (bundled seed metadata)
and `kotoba selfhost check` (validate the bundled seeds against the contract
schema, without invoking any Rust crate — there is none left to invoke).
`src/kotoba/mesh_node.clj` and the safe-build/safe-policy gate consult the
same `safe_analyzer_facts` seed at runtime, so the JVM/Clojure implementation
and the shared EDN facts stay in sync by construction.

An analyzer literally **authored in and executing as Kotoba source** — the
thing earlier revisions of this section described as already existing under
`crates/kotoba-clj/selfhost/` — is not current fact in this repository. It
remains a real, stated forward-looking goal: `kotoba-lang/amu`'s own
README says the bootstrap driving `kotoba -M ...` "currently uses Clojure
internally, but that is not part of the compiler CLI contract and can be
replaced by the self-hosted Kotoba driver without changing user commands"
(compiler README, "After putting `bin/kotoba` on `PATH`..." section). Treat
that as the target state, not the present one: capability (instance-level),
subset, and effect (interprocedural) admission gates are implemented and
tested against the JVM analyzer today; typed HIR / borrow checking (T1) and
an actual Kotoba-authored self-hosted analyzer are tracked in the ADRs as
future work, not shipped code.

Current naming: `kotoba` is the language + database + semantic substrate,
`kotoba wasm` / safe Kotoba is the executable language path that turns Kotoba
into Wasm, and `aiueos` is the OS/component supervisor and capability broker.
`kotoba-clj` remains the implementation crate for that compiler path. In that
split, Rust-free self-hosting means moving authoritative language/admission
semantics into confined Kotoba components slice by slice, while Rust remains
the bootstrap/emitter/oracle for unfinished slices.

The first HTTP/DB provider slices now live in `providers/*.kotoba`. They import
only the bounded `transport-connect`, `tls-open`, `tls-server-end-point`,
`transport-read`, `transport-write`, and `transport-close` ABI; writing the provider in Kotoba
does not grant ambient network access. The source, manifest validation, and
reference lowering are implemented as a prototype. The JVM tender now has an
opt-in native socket/TLS provider and a fail-closed linker between independent
Wasm memories, exercised by compiled `.kotoba` HTTP and framed DB components.
Browser raw transport remains unavailable. Node now has an opt-in worker/SAB
transport with exact endpoint and resolved-address allowlists, finite quotas
and mandatory TLS verification. It compiles the `.kotoba` HTTP provider and
links its exports to a separate consumer Wasm memory through bounded explicit
buffer copies; the end-to-end fixture performs a real local TLS exchange.

The PostgreSQL provider additionally performs SCRAM-SHA-256 and
SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS in `.kotoba`. PLUS obtains only the RFC 5929
`tls-server-end-point` digest from its affine TLS channel; it cannot request a
certificate private key, raw socket, trust-store bypass, or root credential.
The password remains behind the purpose-bound `scram-sha256` host operation.
The database component also exposes a bounded `pg-query-state` operation. It
validates ErrorResponse framing and returns the ReadyForQuery transaction state
without granting the consumer direct transport access; released-server
qualification covers `BEGIN -> error -> ROLLBACK` as `T -> E -> I`.
Cancellation uses a separate one-shot opaque authority. Backend PID/secret
bytes never cross into consumer memory; the native TCB can emit only the fixed
PostgreSQL CancelRequest to the authenticated session's pinned peer. Released
PostgreSQL qualification covers `pg_sleep(10)` cancellation, SQLSTATE `57014`,
idle recovery, double-use denial, and handle cleanup.
Named prepared statements are also lifted into `.kotoba`: bounded
`pg-prepare`, two-independent-parameter `pg-execute-params2`, and
`pg-close-statement` component operations. Released PostgreSQL qualification
prepares `select $1::int4 + $2::int4`, reuses it twice, proves SQL text supplied
as a parameter remains data via SQLSTATE `22P02`, and closes the statement.
The generalized bounded path accepts up to sixteen explicit type OIDs and
sixteen independently validated text, binary, or NULL values. Its released
server proof combines three `int4` parameters in text/NULL/binary formats,
then recovers and reuses the statement after a rejected SQL-looking value.
Named portals provide bounded cursor semantics inside an explicit transaction:
Bind uses the same validated parameter fragment, each Fetch is capped at 1024
rows, PortalSuspended and CommandComplete are distinguished, and portal Close
is explicit. Released PostgreSQL qualification fetches a three-row series as
two rows followed by one row and releases every statement/session handle.
COPY IN and COPY OUT use separate bounded protocol state machines. COPY IN
accepts one independently scoped buffer of at most 4096 bytes only after a
valid CopyInResponse; COPY OUT requires CopyOutResponse, zero or more CopyData
frames, CopyDone, CommandComplete and ReadyForQuery in exact order. Released
server qualification imports and exports three rows and verifies their sum.
Bounded batch execution accepts at most eight named statement descriptors and
their validated parameter fragments. The provider emits Bind/Execute pairs
followed by one Sync, requires one completion pair per successful item, drains
mid-batch errors through ReadyForQuery, and proves same-session recovery after
PostgreSQL's ignore-until-Sync behavior.
Pool return is guarded by `pg-session-reset`: ROLLBACK is drained first, then
DISCARD ALL clears prepared statements, portals, temporary relations, session
settings, LISTEN registrations, advisory locks and cached plans. Any malformed
or error response makes the channel ineligible for reuse. Released-server
qualification dirties all representative state, resets it and proves a clean
subsequent query on the same affine channel.
The pool table exposes only opaque pool and monotonic lease tokens. Consumer
components cannot import or observe the underlying i64 channel, TLS, SCRAM,
query parser or reset operation. The native table owns only mutable membership
and lease freshness; it delegates all PostgreSQL protocol work to compiled
`.kotoba` providers. Release removes the token before reset, and reset failure
closes and evicts the physical channel.
SCRAM credential and TLS trust material are fresh-resolved for every new proof
and TLS open. A trusted control-plane generation swap affects only new
connections; an existing authenticated channel remains bound to its original
credential and peer certificate. Guest components cannot access either
resolver or trigger rotation, and retired password character arrays are
zeroed after replacement.

## Current repositories (CLJC, post-migration)

This repo (`kotoba-lang/kotoba`) is the launcher + host-adapter substrate. Its
`deps.edn` and CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) pull in the sibling repos that
hold the rest of the stack as `:local/root`/git dependencies, not `crates/`
subdirectories:

| Repo | Role |
|---|---|
| `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang` | the language/CLI semantic authority — `.kotoba` source contract, `lang/cli.edn` command contract, conformance fixtures |
| `kotoba-lang/amu` | canonical `.kotoba` frontend/KIR and the restricted kotoba-script backend |
| `kotoba-lang/kotoba-core-contracts` | core CID/contract types shared across hosts |
| `kotoba-lang/kotoba-selfhost-contracts` | self-hosting analyzer contract |
| `kotoba-lang/datom` | canonical datom model (`[e a v]` / entity↔EAVT) shared by `kotoba.kgraph` (this repo's in-memory view) and kotobase's persistent store — the concrete substrate behind **kotoba : kotobase = Clojure : Datomic** (ADR-2607032500) |

| `kotoba-lang/security` | shared security tooling consumed by this repo's package-admission and grade-A gates |

In this repo, `src/kotoba/` holds the host implementation. Core: `launcher.clj`
(dispatch), `wasm_exec.clj` (Wasm execution via Chicory), `git_adapter.cljc` /
`rad_adapter.cljc` (git and RAD sovereign-repo adapters), `graph_adapter.clj`

The database/runtime crates described below (`kotoba-core`, `kotoba-graph`,
`kotoba-store`, `kotoba-runtime`, `kotoba-auth`, `kotoba-signal`, …) were a
**Rust workspace removed from this repository** (`604896171b`, 2026-07-01).
They're kept here as a design-vocabulary reference — the same names/roles
recur throughout the Architecture, Query Surfaces, and Performance sections
below — while the CLJC-native successors land per
[ADR-2607022600](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2607022600-kotoba-database-crates-cljc-migration-roadmap.md).
None of the `cargo` commands or `crates/*` paths below are runnable in this
repository today.

## Crates, architecture & performance (historical Rust design record)

The pre-migration Rust implementation's crate table, canonical write/query
architecture, SPARQL query surfaces, and benchmark numbers are kept as a
design-vocabulary reference in
[`docs/HISTORICAL-RUST-ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/HISTORICAL-RUST-ARCHITECTURE.md)
rather than in this README — that Rust workspace was removed from this
repository (`604896171b`, 2026-07-01), and per
[ADR-2607032500](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2607032500-kotoba-kotobase-clojure-datomic-relationship.md)
the persistent, distributed database itself is not this repository's
identity — that's [`kotoba-lang/kotobase`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase).
This repo is the language; the CLJC-native rebuild of the database design is
tracked in [ADR-2607022600](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2607022600-kotoba-database-crates-cljc-migration-roadmap.md).

## Native compilation and execution

WebAssembly is one Kotoba backend, not the compiler architecture. The current
[`amu`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/amu) pipeline admits source once, lowers
checked KIR through target-neutral GMIR and target-selected MIR, and emits
x86-64 or AArch64 instructions directly. Native code generation does not invoke
an assembler, LLVM, a JVM JIT, or a Wasm runtime. The output is a sealed KEXE
artifact rather than an implicitly trusted OS executable.

```bash
# Public Kotoba CLI (no Clojure command or -M compatibility switch)
kotoba compile example.kotoba --target aarch64-macos --output app.kexe
kotoba compile example.kotoba --target x86_64-linux --output app.kexe

# Signing, verification, and measured native execution remain the lower-level
# Amu/Kototama operator surface until their receipt workflow joins this CLI:
amu verify app.kexe
amu run app.signed.kexe --trust pinned-trust.edn \
  --runtime runtime.edn --loader kotoba-loader --policy policy.edn \
  --input input.edn --executor-key executor-key.edn --output run.receipt.edn
```

Native compilation supports generic and explicit x86-64/AArch64 targets for
Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, and iOS. `--run` remains limited to `web` and
`wasm`; the CLI refuses native `--run` rather than silently using a different
runtime or an unmeasured loader.

The verifier treats embedded KIR as hostile, independently validates its
structure, lexical scope, call arities, transitive capability effects, ABI and
resource budgets, regenerates machine code, and compares the sealed bytes. The
admitted execution path signs the KEXE, checks
trust/revocation and local policy, then uses
[`tender-native`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/tender-native) to map code W^X,
expose only policy-derived capability callbacks, execute it in a supervised
loader process, and produce an executor-signed receipt.

Native support is real but deliberately bounded. The qualified scalar,
control-flow, string, pair, record, and sealed-variant slices run on the host
ISA; unsupported aggregates, effects, ABIs, or targets fail closed until their
lowering and verifier rules exist. Wasm Component remains the primary portable
artifact for ordinary applications, while direct native AOT is supported for
explicit targets and trusted low-level/aiueos paths. See Amu's
[`Execution policy`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/amu#execution-policy) for the
current boundary.

## Properties

Properties of **this repository** (`kotoba-lang/kotoba`) as it stands today —
each one exercised directly above in [Quick start](#quick-start):

- **Capability-safe language** — `kotoba wasm` compiles Kotoba/EDN → WASM; **safe Kotoba** confines untrusted/AI-generated modules by deny-by-default capability, subset, and (interprocedural) effect gates — capability confinement (T3) and effect soundness (T2)
- **WASM runtime** — `kotoba wasm emit`/`run` execute real Wasm on the JVM (Chicory), with capability-gated host imports (e.g. graph read/write) reported back as per-call receipts
- **In-memory EAVT datom store** — `kotoba.kgraph` is a pure in-memory `(E,A,V)` graph store backing those host imports; single-index, not persisted, and not the 5-index/Prolly-Tree/content-addressed store described in [Crates, architecture & performance](#crates-architecture--performance-historical-rust-design-record) below (that's kotobase's design)
- **Content-addressed codebase (C5)** — `kotoba codebase init/import/inspect/resolve/merge` persists semantic blocks by CID; source Git remains the authoring workflow
- **CID-pinned package/lock admission** — `kotoba package verify`/`resolve` gate every dependency on a signed, CID-verified manifest before it can reach compilation
- **CACAO-native authz** — a `--cacao` delegation-chain option is wired through the launcher (`cacao.core`, `kotoba.lang.capability-cacao`) for host commands that accept one
- **`did:key` / `did:web`** — local DID document construction and resolution (`did_adapter.cljc`, ADR-2607050100)

Properties of the **persistent, distributed Datom database** — this is
[`kotoba-lang/kotobase`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase)'s identity,
not this repository's; the bullets below describe that design (largely as
implemented in the removed Rust workspace, being rebuilt CLJC-native per
[ADR-2607022600](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2607022600-kotoba-database-crates-cljc-migration-roadmap.md)):

- **Content-addressed** — IPFS-compatible CIDv1 sha2-256 over raw / dag-pb / dag-cbor blocks
- **Immutable datoms** — Datomic-style 5-tuple `(E,A,V,T,Added)` with retract tombstones
- **5-index arrangement** — EAVT / AEVT / AVET / VAET / TEA for O(1)–O(log n) access
- **Prolly Tree storage** — deterministic, hash-consistent B-tree over blocks
- **Distributed Pregel** — BSP graph computation across nodes via libp2p
- **AT Protocol native** — Datom projection backed by commit DAG and JetStream
- **E2E encryption** — Signal Protocol + CACAO auth for consent-gated data
- **Datomic/Datalog primary, SPARQL auxiliary** — the distributed Datom DB is the source of truth; SPARQL 1.1 reads the same projection for RDF-compatible query and federation
- **CACAO-native authz** — depth-2 delegation chains, multi-graph grants, anti-replay nonce
- **X-Road-style accountability** — ciphertext-only replication, purpose-declared + signed + receipted key release via t-of-N custodians, anchored tamper-evident audit log, slashable unreceipted releases. See [`docs/SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE.md)

## kotoba-shell release pipeline (design, not yet shipped)

`kotoba-shell` — a desktop/mobile app shell layer over safe Kotoba components
and the aiueos shell surface — is designed in
[`docs/ADR-kotoba-shell-aiueos-safe-kotoba.md`](docs/ADR-kotoba-shell-aiueos-safe-kotoba.md).
There is no `kotoba shell` subcommand wired up in this repo's launcher yet
(current commands: see [Quick start](#quick-start)); treat the ADR as the
design record, not a usable CLI.

## Build and test

Use the Kotoba CLI for the normal project lifecycle. The source-checkout form
below is identical to the installed `kotoba` command:

```bash
bin/kotoba rad new --project /tmp/hello
bin/kotoba test --project /tmp/hello --profile test
bin/kotoba build --project /tmp/hello --profile release
```

`kotoba test` admits and checks the project's Kotoba source. `kotoba build` admits the
package lock and emits `target/hello.wasm`; a rejected lock or unsupported
construct fails the command. This is the public build/test path
described by [kotoba-lang.org](https://kotoba-lang.org/) and the versioned
[`kotoba` CLI contract](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang/blob/main/docs/generated/cli.md).
`kotoba rad build` and `kotoba rad test` remain compatibility spellings.

Repository-maintainer conformance, lint, security, Python SDK, and release gates
run on the Murakumo fleet. Their implementation details are internal gates, not
the user-facing Kotoba project build command. This repository has no Rust build;
see [Current repositories](#current-repositories-cljc-post-migration).

## ADR

Design decisions live in
[`90-docs/adr/2605240001-kotoba-cleanroom-architecture.md`](https://github.com/etzhayyim/etzhayyim-apps-etzhayyim/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2605240001-kotoba-cleanroom-architecture.md)
of the parent monorepo.  Section §27 captures the current SPARQL surface,
HTTP loadtest matrix, and operator-UX defaults.
