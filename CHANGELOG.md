# Changelog

This log starts here — it doesn't attempt to reconstruct the full project
history (see `git log` for that). Entries going forward should summarize
user-visible or architecturally significant changes.

## Unreleased

- Added `kotoba.runtime/cap-affine-problems` (narrow S2, deterministic drop
  / no implicit clone): a capability-typed value — a `^{:cap <kind>}` param,
  a `(cap-acquire ...)` result, or a let-bound alias of either — may be
  consumed at most once along any single execution path through a function
  body; reuse is rejected as `:cap-value-reused`. Deliberately scoped to
  capability values only, not a general Rust-style ownership/borrow system
  (T1 Memory Safety was already achieved without one). Documented
  conservative limitation: tracking is per local binding name, not per
  underlying value, so renaming through a `let`-alias and using both names
  once each is an uncaught reuse — does not weaken runtime confinement,
  since every `<op>-with` use still re-resolves through
  `kotoba.cap-table/resolve-use` regardless of alias.
- Reinstated `.cljs` as a directly-runnable source extension (bumped the
  `kotoba-core-contracts` pin, which gained a `:cljs` source-kind mirroring
  `.clj`'s single-target shape). `src/demo.cljs` proves a bare `.cljs` file
  is accepted and defaults to the `:cljs` reader target with no
  `--reader-target` flag needed.
- Added `test/kotoba/cap_table_test.clj`: direct unit coverage of
  `kotoba.cap-table` (handle sequencing across multiple acquisitions on the
  same table, and `resolve-use`'s three denial branches called in
  isolation) — previously only exercised indirectly through
  `cap_passing_test.clj`'s end-to-end launcher tests.
- **Breaking**: `kotoba wasm emit` and `kotoba wasm run` now require
  `--package-lock <path>` unconditionally — the package-admission gate always
  runs first, and a missing or rejected lock aborts the build/run with the
  admission receipt/error in the payload (`:wasm/package-rejected`). Closes
  the F-001 gap where the flag was optional for `wasm emit` and entirely
  absent for `wasm run` (a caller could skip package verification just by not
  passing the flag). There is no opt-out.
- Added `clj-kondo` lint (Clojars-based, no system install) and fixed the
  handful of warnings it surfaced (unused requires/bindings/params in
  `kotoba.runtime`), so CI now runs both tests and lint.
- Documented every public function in `kotoba.runtime` (the WASM-compiling
  CLJ execution core) that previously had no docstring.
- `deps.edn` moved off `:local/root` monorepo-only paths for its base
  dependencies onto real git-SHA pins, so a fresh standalone clone builds
  without needing sibling checkouts (the old paths only resolved inside the
  west monorepo layout).
- Dropped the Charter Compliance Rider; the project is licensed as plain
  Apache-2.0.
- README refreshed to describe the current CLJC-based design and drop
  stale claims from the retired Rust-era implementation.
