;; bin/kbb_shim.cljs — the kbb front door (ADR-2607181900 gate item ①,
;; ADR-2609051100 task 4). `bin/kbb` execs this under nbb, so the DRIVER
;; never starts a JVM; only an explicit `--backend interpreter` does, and
;; it says so by name.
;;
;; Two JVM-free backends sit behind this door and they host different
;; capability surfaces. Routing between them is the whole job:
;;
;;   native  amu compile --target <isa> --jvm-free -> KEXE -> the measured
;;           kexe_loader. Hosts :fs/app-data (wire 35: read, write and the
;;           RANGE_SEP ranged read) and :fs/browse (wire 34); the wire-33/20
;;           providers are still stubs on this backend (ADR-2609051100 task
;;           5). `--fuel` reaches the loader as KEXE_FUEL (default 512). This
;;           is the DISTRIBUTION artifact.
;;   js      bin/kbb_js.cljs: amu compile --target js --jvm-free -> restricted
;;           ESM instantiated in this Node process. Hosts :fs/app-data,
;;           :env/read, :fs/browse, :proc/exec and :git/run (wire 35/33/34/20/22).
;;
;; Dispatch, with `--backend` absent (the default, :auto):
;;   caps subset of {:fs/app-data}                        -> native
;;   caps subset of the js host's five                    -> js (this is
;;           where :fs/browse scripts go for now: see `native-auto`)
;;   anything else                                        -> REFUSE, exit 3
;; An explicit --backend native admits {:fs/app-data :fs/browse}.
;;
;; NO SILENT FALLBACK (ADR-2609051100). A surface no JVM-free backend hosts
;; is refused BY NAME with a distinct exit code (3, neither 0 nor 1) that
;; says which capabilities forced it and that `--backend interpreter` --
;; the JVM -- is where they live. Before this, the default route refused
;; every surface outside {:fs/app-data} and pointed at the JVM even when
;; the JVM-free js host could run it; :data/json, :data/edn and :http/fetch
;; are the surfaces that genuinely still need the interpreter, because they
;; are absent from kotoba-lang capability-catalog.edn altogether and so have
;; no wire id for any compiled guest to call.
;;
;; Exit codes: 0 ok | 1 the run failed | 3 no JVM-free backend hosts this
;; surface | the interpreter's own code when --backend interpreter is asked.
