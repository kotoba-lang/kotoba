(ns kotoba.wasm-exec
  "Actually EXECUTE the bytes `kotoba.runtime/wasm-binary` emits, via
  com.dylibso.chicory (a pure-JVM WebAssembly runtime — no native toolchain,
  no wasmtime/wasmer process). This is the piece that closes the
  compile -> check -> emit -> RUN loop: until this namespace existed, nothing
  in this repository ever ran the emitted module, only inspected its byte
  layout (magic bytes, import/function counts).

  Host functions here are a thin (Instance memory ptr/len) <-> EDN adapter
  over the pure `kotoba.kgraph` store, matching the (ptr,len[,out-ptr,out-cap])
  ABI already used by the existing string-passing host imports
  (clipboard-write-str, http-fetch, ...). A production host (browser,
  Cloudflare Worker, ...) implements the SAME (module=\"kotoba\", field) import
  surface in its own runtime; this namespace is the JVM one, used here to
  prove — not just assert — that emitted modules run.

  Runtime capability enforcement (ADR-2607050500): `kotoba.runtime/check`
  only refuses to EMIT a host import a compile-time policy doesn't allow —
  it says nothing about what actually happens when the resulting bytes are
  RUN, and until now `has-capability-fn` was a permissive stub that granted
  every capability id unconditionally regardless of any policy. `instantiate`
  / `run-main` now take an optional POLICY (same EDN vocabulary as
  kotoba.host-providers/kotoba.runtime/check) and build a real
  `has_capability` host function that maps the i32 id the guest passes back
  to a capability name (via kotoba.runtime/capability-contract) and checks it
  against POLICY — no POLICY means nothing is granted (fail closed), not the
  previous always-1 behavior. `kgraph-host-functions`' 2-/3-arg forms extend
  the same fail-closed guarding (via kotoba.lang.capability-host/guard-call,
  mirroring kotoba.host-providers/host-call) to the effectful kgraph-* ops
  themselves, not just the has-capability? query; the 1-arg form stays
  unguarded for backward compatibility (see its docstring). A per-instance
  instruction-count fuel limit (`fuel-listener`, wired into `instantiate` via
  com.dylibso.chicory.runtime.Instance.Builder/withUnsafeExecutionListener)
  bounds execution against a runaway/looping guest instead of hanging or
  blowing the JVM stack uncontrolled."
