  "Wires kotoba-lang/did's pure DID helpers into kotoba's capability-host
  surface — the shape the `com.etzhayyim.apps.kotoba.did.document` lexicon
  endpoints (`publish`) need. did:key and did:web document construction and
  local resolution require no I/O (see did.core/resolve-local's own
  docstring), so unlike kotoba.git-adapter / kotoba.rad-adapter there is no
  injected host port to implement — every function here is pure data in,
  pure data out. Before this namespace, `kotoba-lang/did` had zero consumers
  in the org (ADR-2607050100); this is its first real wiring."
