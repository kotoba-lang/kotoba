(ns kotoba.codebase-publish
  "Publish a namespace, and follow one, over ordinary HTTP.

  Announcing a CID to the IPFS DHT needs a libp2p node, which this workspace
  does not have. That leaves discovery half-built: `codebase-routing` can find
  and verify blocks that someone already provides, and nothing could make a
  definition BE provided. This closes that half without pretending to be a
  peer-to-peer network.

  A publishing node is two things at once and nothing more:

  - a **trustless gateway** -- `GET /ipfs/{cid}?format=raw` -- which is exactly
    what `codebase-routing` already speaks, so a published store is reachable
    by the same client that reads the public network;
  - a **follower that also serves**. It pins a publisher DID per namespace on
    first push and applies the same signature, sequence and chain checks a
    private follower does, so hosting someone's namespace grants them nothing
    beyond what they proved.

  Serving is not authority. The server verifies every pushed block against its
  CID before storing it, and every head record against the key it pinned; what
  it cannot do is make a follower believe anything, because the follower checks
  the same things again. That is the point of the record being signed rather
  than the connection being trusted."
