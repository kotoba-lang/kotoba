  "Safe-execution admission gate for Kotoba package inputs (issue #262 / F-001).

  Validates a `kotoba.lock.edn` (and optionally the package manifest it locks)
  through the `kotoba.lang.package-contract` validation kernel from
  kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang, and layers launcher-owned safe-mode checks on top
  (local-path dependencies are never admitted). Every verification — accept or
  reject — emits a package-verification receipt; the receipt is the
  release-evidence artifact required before a safe build may proceed.

  `manifest-integrity-error` closes a real gap `kotoba.lang.package-contract/
  cid?` alone doesn't (kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang#13 made `cid?` a genuine
  CIDv1 structural check, but structural validity says nothing about
  whether a CID actually matches the content it claims to pin): a
  manifest's own self-declared `:manifest-cid` is recomputed from the
  manifest's actual content (canonical DAG-CBOR + CIDv1, `cbor.core`/
  `multiformats.core`) and compared against the declared value. A manifest
  edited without updating its pinned CID -- or a manifest whose CID was
  copied from a different package entirely -- is rejected here, where the
  previous shape-only check would have silently accepted it as long as the
  string merely looked CID-shaped."

  must be computed OVER TOP OF, never included IN. :manifest-cid's exclusion
  is the obvious case (the same reason a git commit's hash never covers its
  own hash, or an IPFS DAG node's CID never covers its own CID field).
  :signatures' exclusion is required for the SAME reason once
  `kotoba.lang.package-contract/signatures-error` does real Ed25519
  verification (kotoba-lang PR #16, 2607131500): a signer's :sig attests to
  this manifest's :manifest-cid (`(signed-bytes manifest-cid)`), so if
  :manifest-cid's own hash also covered :signatures, producing a
  self-consistent manifest+signature pair would require solving a circular
  fixed point (the signature depends on the CID, and -- had :signatures not
  been excluded here -- the CID would depend on the signature) with no
  general closed-form solution. Excluding :signatures from the hashed
  content breaks the cycle: the CID is a pure function of the manifest's
  substantive fields, computed once, then signed, and the signature can be
  attached/rotated/added afterward without ever changing what the CID
  covers.

  KNOWN LIMITATION (independent review of PR #305, 2607131600): since
  :manifest-cid no longer covers :signatures, the CID cannot bind WHICH or
  HOW MANY signers vouched for this content -- `signatures-error` verifies
  every signature entry PRESENT is individually valid, but nothing requires
  a minimum count, a quorum, or membership in an authorized-signer set,
  so a manifest with one legitimate co-signer's entry silently removed (CID
  untouched) still passes admission today. Not currently exploitable
  because no policy in this codebase relies on that binding yet (this repo's
  only signer-list logic, :dep/signers in LOCK entries, is unrelated -- it
  gates dependencies against a revoked/expired/compromised denylist, not a
  manifest's own signer set). An n-of-m or quorum signing policy, if ever
  built, needs its own binding mechanism independent of :manifest-cid."
