  "Shared local operator seed for kotoba and murakumo.

  One file, one Ed25519 seed, two CLIs. kotoba reads it when
  `KOTOBA_CODEBASE_SEED` is unset; murakumo should read the same path when
  `MURAKUMO_OPERATOR_SEED` is unset (sibling PR). The seed itself is never a
  CLI return value — callers receive only did:key and the IPNS name.

  Path contract (copy this string):
    ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/kotoba/operator.seed

  The file is 64 lowercase hex characters plus a trailing newline, mode 0600.
  The parent directory `kotoba/` is created at 0700. Existing files are not
  overwritten unless the caller passes `:force?`."
