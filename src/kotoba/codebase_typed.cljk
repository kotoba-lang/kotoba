  "Source in, KIR-derived definitions out.

  This is the join the workspace was missing. `kotoba-lang/codebase` owns
  content-addressed identity and refuses to parse source; `kotoba-lang/amu`
  owns checking and lowering and knows nothing about a codebase. Only here are
  both on the classpath, so only here can a `.kotoba` file become definitions
  whose identity IS the checked KIR the backends consume.

  Nothing about the compiler is reimplemented: the source goes through the same
  `check-source` admission and the same `lower` that a `kotoba compile` runs, and
  the resulting KIR is handed to the codebase whole."

  This is where the two content-addressed halves meet. `module-lock` pins the

  `typed-code` hashes the resulting definitions -- what they mean. Neither
  implies the other: the same pinned bytes under a different compiler contract
  produce different definitions, and two different sources can produce the same
  definition. Linking them here means a namespace update can name the exact
  input set it came from, and the returned `:lock-cid` is what a receipt binds
  so that claim is checkable later.

  The linked project is compiled as one module, so a `:require` across the
