  "Publish a namespace head into the real DHT as an IPNS record.

  The previous pass concluded that announcing needed a libp2p node this
  workspace did not have, and settled for asking a pinning service. That was
  wrong about the workspace: `io-libp2p-specs-kad-dht` already speaks
  `/routing/v1` with multi-router quorum, and `tech-ipfs-specs-ipns` already
  implements the IPNS record any IPFS implementation validates. Delegated
  routers ARE DHT nodes; publishing through them puts the record at the same
  DHT key a Kubo node would write, and any peer can resolve it.

  What that buys is larger than announcement. An IPNS name is derived from the
  publisher's public key, so:

  - **the name needs no registry.** `k51…` is the key, not a lookup in someone's
    table, which removes the piece the HTTP publication path could not supply;
  - **key distribution disappears.** A follower that knows the name knows the
    key, because the name IS the key;
  - **the endpoint stops being load-bearing.** Following used to require
    knowing where to ask. Now a name resolves through any routers, and the
    endpoint is only where blocks happen to be fetched from.

  What it is still not: this process is not a DHT node. It holds no routing
  table and answers nobody's queries -- the honest description
  `io-libp2p-specs-kad-dht`'s own README insists on, and repeated here because
  the distinction is exactly the one this namespace could be mistaken for
  erasing.

  The codebase's signed head record is NOT replaced by the IPNS record. IPNS
  says which head is current and stops there; the head record carries the
  sequence and the predecessor link that make a rollback detectable. Two
  signatures over two different claims, both checked."
