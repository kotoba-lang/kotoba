(ns kotoba.deploy-adapter
  "Host adapter for the :deploy CLI command.

  The command shape is owned by kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang (`lang/cli.edn` +
  `kotoba.cli/dispatch`). This namespace consumes the `:command/planned`
  result for `deploy` and materializes package desired-state against a
  target.

  Destinations (ADR-2607022300):

  * **local receipt** — named target (`dev`), absolute path, or `file:` URI.
    Writes `current.edn` / `previous.edn`. This is package desired-state on
    disk, not a compute host.
  * **murakumo reside** — `--target murakumo`, `murakumo:<node>`, `fleet`,
    or `fleet:<node>`. Compute lives on the murakumo Mac mini fleet. kotoba
    publishes a signed, content-addressed Kekkai desired-state envelope to
    independent mirrors. Murakumo nodes pull it; no sibling checkout or
    Clojure subprocess is part of the public deploy path. Omitting `<node>`
    selects the canary `asher`.
    Apply also names the admitted wasm in the existing IPNS stack
    (`kotoba.codebase-ipns/publish-cid!`, the same path as
    `kotoba codebase publish --ipns`) and prints a murakumo HTTPS / IPNS URL.
  * **not** Deno Deploy, Cloudflare Workers/Pages, Vercel, or aozora. Those
    are other substrates (net-kotobase owns Kotobase CF Workers; aozora is
    identify). This command does not invent a billed hosting product.

  `--dry-run` defaults to true. Reside rollback is fail-closed: a new signed
  desired-state epoch is required rather than mutating an old receipt.

  Planning is pure; filesystem, env, process, and IPNS happen only through
  an injected host port."
