  "Global content discovery for semantic definition blocks.

  Explicit-peer transfer answers `fetch this from that machine`. It does not
  answer `who has this at all`, which is the question a content-addressed
  codebase actually raises: a CID is a global name, and the point of a global
  name is that you can hold one without knowing where it lives.

  This is a client for the two IPFS interfaces that answer it over plain HTTP:

  - **Delegated Routing HTTP API v1** -- `GET /routing/v1/providers/{cid}` asks
    a router (which is backed by the DHT and by indexer networks) who provides
    a CID. Filtering to `transport-ipfs-gateway-http` keeps the answers to
    providers this client can actually talk to.
  - **Trustless Gateway** -- `GET /ipfs/{cid}?format=raw` fetches one block's
    exact bytes, with no path resolution, no directory listing, and nothing the
    server chose.

  `trustless` is the load-bearing word. Every byte returned here is verified
  against the CID that was requested before it is persisted, so a router that
  lies about who has a block, and a gateway that serves the wrong bytes, are
  both merely unhelpful. That is what makes it safe to ask strangers.

  What this does NOT do: publish. Announcing a CID to the DHT requires a libp2p
  node, so a block only becomes globally discoverable once something that has
  one provides it. Discovery being possible is not the same as content being
  there, and this namespace deliberately reports an empty provider set rather
  than implying otherwise."
