(ns kotoba.kbb-native
  "kbb v2 native backend slice (ADR-2607181900 JVM-free readiness gate).

  The v1 bootstrap host runs `.kotoba` scripts on the JVM interpreter slice
  (~10-18s cold start). This namespace executes a script's capability-bearing
  surface through the EXISTING native AOT backend instead: kotoba.compiler
  emits raw machine code for the host ISA, kotoba.verifier signs it, and
  kototama.native.executor runs it under the measured kexe_loader supervisor
  (~11ms process cold start).

  Semantics are deliberately narrow (slice, not the full JVM-free kbb):
  capability host calls have no lowering in the native backend, so a
  permitted `proc-exec` invocation is PRE-EXECUTED on the policy side --
  through the same guarded host-call path and receipt journal the v1
  interpreter uses -- and the guest source's `(proc-exec \"<index>\")` forms
  are rewritten to the invocation's exit-status word before compilation. The
  guest never sees command bytes (the policy table owns them, unchanged from
  slice 2); the native artifact is admitted with an EMPTY capability allow
  bitmap because no capability call remains in it.

  Scripts whose capability surface is not proc-exec are refused closed: this
  slice hosts nothing else."
