  Parsing is mechanism; what a grant covers is the decision, and that moved
  to `cores/resource_scope_core.cljk` (Q9 wave 1). The core takes these
  fields and nothing else, so it never has to reimplement java.net.URI.

  `:scheme \"\"` means S did not parse at all, and `:host \"\"` that the
  authority was not server-based. Both fail closed in the core through the
  ordinary path rather than through a sentinel every caller has to test for.
  `:port -1` is URI.getPort's own encoding of an absent port."
