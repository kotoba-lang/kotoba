(ns kotoba.reproducible-emit
  "Cross-machine reproducibility gate for the safe-build emitter.

  `kotoba wasm emit` is deterministic in practice — the same source emits the
  same bytes — but nothing held it to that, so a change that made the output
  depend on iteration order, a path, a locale or a clock would land silently.
  This namespace records the digest every source is expected to emit and fails
  when the emitted bytes disagree.

  The recorded digests are checked in, so CI on a different machine, a
  different absolute path and a different JVM must reproduce them. That is a
  stronger claim than emitting twice in one process and comparing: same input
  -> same output *anywhere*, which is the property `kotoba.security.
  supply-chain/evaluate-reproducibility` asks for and could not previously be
  given real evidence for.

  A digest is bound to a **(source, policy) pair**, not to a source alone: the
  granted capabilities become Wasm imports, so they are part of the input. The
  policy is recorded next to the digest rather than inferred, because the
  sibling-file convention (`demo_x.kotoba` -> `demo_x_policy.edn`) does not
  cover every demo — several share `demo_provider_policy.edn` — and inferring
  it wrongly records a source as uncompilable when it compiles fine.

  Every source under `src/` is recorded, including those that do not emit — an
  unlisted source is an error, and so is a source that starts or stops emitting
  successfully without the manifest being updated. A gate that silently skips
  what it cannot compile reports coverage it does not have.
