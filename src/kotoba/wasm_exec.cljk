  "Actually EXECUTE the bytes `kotoba.runtime/wasm-binary` emits, via
  com.dylibso.chicory (a pure-JVM WebAssembly runtime — no native toolchain,
  no wasmtime/wasmer process). This is the piece that closes the
  compile -> check -> emit -> RUN loop: until this namespace existed, nothing
  in this repository ever ran the emitted module, only inspected its byte
  layout (magic bytes, import/function counts).

  Host functions here are a thin (Instance memory ptr/len) <-> EDN adapter
  over the pure `kotoba.kgraph` store, matching the (ptr,len[,out-ptr,out-cap])
  ABI already used by the existing string-passing host imports
  (clipboard-write-str, http-fetch, ...). A production host (browser,
  Cloudflare Worker, ...) implements the SAME (module=\"kotoba\", field) import
  surface in its own runtime; this namespace is the JVM one, used here to
  prove — not just assert — that emitted modules run.

  A host implementing this ABI MUST validate the output window before
  depositing a result: `out-ptr`/`out-cap` are guest-supplied, so a host that
  checks only that the payload fits `out-cap` will write wherever it is told.
  See `writable-output-window` for the bounds and why each one is there.

  Not a duplicate of `kotoba-lang/kototama`'s `kototama.tender` (also
  JVM/Chicory): that is a *separate* repo's production/compat runtime,
  hosting already-emitted `.wasm` under capability grants `aiueos` decides
  (per that repo's own README, its own JVM/Chicory tender is itself
  'compat / CI, not primary' relative to native WASM AOT execution).
  This namespace exists so `kotoba-lang/kotoba`'s own emit path (`kotoba.runtime`)
  can prove its own output runs, in this repo's own test suite, without a
  cross-repo test dependency on kototama. See
  com-junkawasaki/root ADR-2607182200 for the full cross-repo dependency
  graph and why these two are not considered the same thing to consolidate.

  Runtime capability enforcement (ADR-2607050500): `kotoba.runtime/check`
  only refuses to EMIT a host import a compile-time policy doesn't allow —
  it says nothing about what actually happens when the resulting bytes are
  RUN, and until now `has-capability-fn` was a permissive stub that granted
  every capability id unconditionally regardless of any policy. `instantiate`
  / `run-main` now take an optional POLICY (same EDN vocabulary as
  kotoba.host-providers/kotoba.runtime/check) and build a real
  `has_capability` host function that maps the i32 id the guest passes back
  to a capability name (via kotoba.runtime/capability-contract) and checks it
  against POLICY — no POLICY means nothing is granted (fail closed), not the
  previous always-1 behavior. `kgraph-host-functions`' 2-/3-arg forms extend
  the same fail-closed guarding (via kotoba.lang.capability-host/guard-call,
  mirroring kotoba.host-providers/host-call) to the effectful kgraph-* ops
  themselves, not just the has-capability? query; the 1-arg form stays
  unguarded for backward compatibility (see its docstring). A per-instance
  instruction-count fuel limit (`fuel-listener`, wired into `instantiate` via
  com.dylibso.chicory.runtime.Instance.Builder/withUnsafeExecutionListener)
  bounds execution against a runaway/looping guest instead of hanging or
  blowing the JVM stack uncontrolled."

  grants and kotoba.host-providers/local-policy — the SAME derivation
  kotoba.host-providers/host-call uses for the CLJ-interpreter path, reused
  rather than reinvented. A denied call throws BEFORE EFFECT ever touches
  any real resource (memory, filesystem, network, ...) — fail closed,
  matching host-providers/host-call's contract; every attempt — granted,
  denied, or a handler error — is receipted via RECORD! when supplied
  (OPTS may also carry :now, an ISO date string defaulting to today).
  Generic across every guarded op this namespace wires (kgraph-*, and the
  provider/kernel-capability/actor-host surface in `real-op-effects`), not
  kgraph-specific despite the historical name this replaces
  (`guard-kgraph-call`).
