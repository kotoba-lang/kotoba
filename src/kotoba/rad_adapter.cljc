(ns kotoba.rad-adapter
  "Host adapter for the :rad CLI command.

  The command shape is owned by kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang (`lang/cli.edn` +
  `kotoba.cli/dispatch`). This namespace consumes the `:command/planned`
  result for `rad` and turns it into steps over a Kotoba package:

  - :new    scaffolds a package (draft package.edn + main source) via fs steps
  - :build  emits the wasm artifact by re-dispatching `wasm emit` in-process
  - :test   checks the main source by re-dispatching `check` in-process
  - :export emits the wasm artifact to an explicit --output path

  Planning is pure; filesystem writes and launcher dispatch happen only
  through an injected host port, so the core makes no direct host calls."
