(ns kotoba.codebase-compile
  "Compile a stored definition to a target artifact, cached and receipted.

  The codebase could run a definition through the language oracle but could not
  emit anything, so `what does this hash compile to` had no answer and the
  build cache -- whose descriptor was already written to bind code closure,
  compiler contract, target ABI, package lock and policy -- had nothing to key.

  Compilation here starts from CIDs, not from a file. `typed-eval/assemble`
  hydrates the closure into one KIR module whose functions are named by their
  own hashes, and the backend consumes that module exactly as it consumes one
  lowered from source. Two consequences follow and both are the point:

  - the cache key is a property of the definition graph, so a hit is safe
    across machines, checkouts and namespaces -- nothing in it is a path or a
    name;
  - an effectful definition is not cached at all. `store/cache-key` returns nil
    for a descriptor with declared effects, and that is deliberate: reuse means
    'the answer is the same', which is a claim nobody can make about a call
    that talks to the outside world;
  - neither is anything, when the toolchain cannot say which revision it is.
    Compiling again costs time; handing back bytes emitted by a different
    compiler is a wrong answer."
