  (origin id -> the op that consumed it, for every capability VALUE already
  consumed on every path reaching EXPR), and COUNTER (the next fresh origin
  id to assign to a `(cap-acquire ...)` occurrence). Sequencing:

  - `do`/function-body/`def` values thread USED and COUNTER left-to-right
    (each form sees everything the previous ones consumed, and every
    `cap-acquire` occurrence gets its own never-repeated origin);
  - `let` evaluates each binding's value under the PRE-binding env/used/
    counter (so a value referencing a name this same let is about to
    shadow still sees the outer binding), assigns the new binding's
    `{:kind :origin}` via cap-expr-info (fresh origin for a direct
    `cap-acquire`, shared origin for an alias), and threads USED/COUNTER
    through the bindings and then the body in order. USED is keyed by
    origin, not by local name, so unlike CAP-ENV it never needs scope-exit
    filtering: an origin created inside a let remains a globally unique
    identifier for that one capability value for the rest of the function,
    so two sibling `(let [c ...] ...)` blocks reusing the name `c` for two
    DIFFERENT `cap-acquire` calls get two different origins automatically
    and can never be confused, regardless of lexical scope;
  - `if` evaluates its test under the incoming USED/COUNTER, then evaluates
    BOTH branches independently from the same post-test USED (only one
    branch ever runs at runtime) and continues with the UNION of what each
    branch consumed -- a binding consumed in EITHER branch must be treated
    as possibly-already-consumed by whatever follows, since a downstream
    reuse on the branch actually taken would otherwise go undetected. The
    else branch continues numbering origins from wherever the then branch
    left COUNTER (an arbitrary but harmless ordering artifact -- origins
    across the two branches never collide, and downstream code continues
    from the higher of the two);
  - a capability-typed value reaching an `<op>-with` leading argument or a
    callee's `^{:cap <kind>}` parameter position is a consuming use
    (affine-use), checked AFTER recursing into the argument itself (so a
    reuse nested inside a complex argument expression is still caught)."

;; ADR-2607151500: ClojureScript backend -- a SECOND, genuinely separate
;; execution target for `.kotoba`, alongside compile-wasm-expr/wasm-binary
;; above. Covers ONLY the narrow-slice governor-style op set (int/keyword/
;; map literals, let/if/do/and/or/when, pair/pair-first/pair-second, get/
;; assoc, +/-/*/quot//rem/mod/comparisons, not/zero?/pos?/neg?/inc/dec,
;; named function calls) -- explicitly NOT i64/f32 typed ops, bitwise ops,
;; string ops, memory ops (alloc/i32-store!/mem-i32-at/byte-at/etc as raw
;; user-facing ops), or capability ops (cap-acquire/has-capability?/
;; call-indirect). kotoba-lang/compiler's own cljs backend (ADR-2607151500,
;; src/kotoba/compiler/backend/cljs.clj) landed its map/keyword/get/assoc/
;; loop-recur subset first and added cap-call support as a later, separate
;; addendum; the same incremental, honestly-scoped discipline applies here.
;;
;; Unlike compile-wasm-expr, this needs NO `locals`/`fns` context threaded
;; through recursive calls -- WASM locals need numeric INDICES (hence
;; compile-wasm-expr's local-index bookkeeping), but cljs's own `let`/`defn`
;; bind SYMBOLIC names directly, so lowering is a simple form -> form
;; rewrite (mirroring kotoba-lang/compiler's backend/cljs.clj `lower-expr`,
;; which has the same shape for the same reason).
;;
;; Two semantics kotoba's WASM output gets for free from the `if`/
;; comparison WASM OPCODES THEMSELVES (0-is-false via the `if` instruction;
;; i32.eq/i32.lt_s/etc. natively push 0 or 1) that plain cljs forms do NOT
;; reproduce automatically -- both handled explicitly here, same as
;; compiler/'s cljs backend:
;;   - every `if` wraps its test: `(if (zero? test') else' then')`
;;   - every comparison wraps its result: `(if (op ...) 1 0)`
;;
;; `pair`/`pair-first`/`pair-second`: this repo's WASM path encodes a pair
;; as 8 raw bytes in linear memory (alloc + i32-store!/mem-i32-at) because
;; that's the only heap kotoba/'s WASM target has. A cljs runtime already
;; has real persistent data structures, so here a pair is just a plain
;; 2-element vector + `nth` -- simpler, and `get`'s bounded unroll (reused
;; verbatim below, since it's pure form construction that recurses through
;; whichever `compile-*-expr` processes its result) inherits this for free.
;;
;; No memory-based host ABI: `kotoba wasm emit` requires a 0-arity `main`
;; because a WASM module can only export a fixed-arity function and real
;; inputs must be marshaled through linear memory -- neither restriction
;; applies to a cljs target, so `defn`s here keep their own declared
;; params and callers pass real arguments directly. This means EXISTING
;; `.kotoba` sources written for the memory-ABI convention (e.g. the
;; `mem-i32-at`-reading cloud-itonami governor ports) do NOT compile
;; unchanged to this target -- a real, documented v1 scope limit, not
;; silently patched over.

  exactly: `(op a b c)` -> `((a op b) op c)`, a single arg passes through
  unchanged, at least one arg is required. This matters beyond `+`/`*`
  (associative, fold order is cosmetic): WASM's comparison opcodes ALSO go
  through this SAME fold, so `(< 3 1 2)` compiles to `((3<1) < 2)` =
  `(0 < 2)` = true -- NOT Clojure's native `<`'s true n-ary \"monotonic\"
  chained-comparison semantics (which would say false, 3 is not < 1).
  Replicating this exact fold, quirky as it is for 3+-arg comparisons, is
  what makes this backend agree with kotoba/'s own WASM target rather than
  silently adopting cljs's more intuitive but DIFFERENT native semantics."
