  (origin id -> the op that consumed it, for every capability VALUE already
  consumed on every path reaching EXPR), and COUNTER (the next fresh origin
  id to assign to a `(cap-acquire ...)` occurrence). Sequencing:

  - `do`/function-body/`def` values thread USED and COUNTER left-to-right
    (each form sees everything the previous ones consumed, and every
    `cap-acquire` occurrence gets its own never-repeated origin);
  - `let` evaluates each binding's value under the PRE-binding env/used/
    counter (so a value referencing a name this same let is about to
    shadow still sees the outer binding), assigns the new binding's
    `{:kind :origin}` via cap-expr-info (fresh origin for a direct
    `cap-acquire`, shared origin for an alias), and threads USED/COUNTER
    through the bindings and then the body in order. USED is keyed by
    origin, not by local name, so unlike CAP-ENV it never needs scope-exit
    filtering: an origin created inside a let remains a globally unique
    identifier for that one capability value for the rest of the function,
    so two sibling `(let [c ...] ...)` blocks reusing the name `c` for two
    DIFFERENT `cap-acquire` calls get two different origins automatically
    and can never be confused, regardless of lexical scope;
  - `if` evaluates its test under the incoming USED/COUNTER, then evaluates
    BOTH branches independently from the same post-test USED (only one
    branch ever runs at runtime) and continues with the UNION of what each
    branch consumed -- a binding consumed in EITHER branch must be treated
    as possibly-already-consumed by whatever follows, since a downstream
    reuse on the branch actually taken would otherwise go undetected. The
    else branch continues numbering origins from wherever the then branch
    left COUNTER (an arbitrary but harmless ordering artifact -- origins
    across the two branches never collide, and downstream code continues
    from the higher of the two);
  - a capability-typed value reaching an `<op>-with` leading argument or a
    callee's `^{:cap <kind>}` parameter position is a consuming use
    (affine-use), checked AFTER recursing into the argument itself (so a
    reuse nested inside a complex argument expression is still caught)."

;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Embedded fuel: a module-private, monotonic call-count trap baked directly
;; into the compiled `.wasm` bytes, so a self-recursive guest is bounded by
;; the ENGINE itself (`unreachable` -> a real trap), not by whatever host
;; happens to run it. Ported from kotoba-lang/compiler's `backend/wasm.cljc`
;; `function-body` charge prologue (same instruction shape, verified there
;; against three independent engines -- Node's native WebAssembly, standalone
;; `wasmtime`, and, transitively, JVM/Chicory), NOT invented fresh here.
;;
;; This closes a real gap `kotoba.wasm-exec/fuel-listener` (a Chicory
;; `ExecutionListener`, see wasm_exec.clj) does NOT: that listener is a
;; HOST-provided instrumentation hook that only exists when a `.wasm` binary
;; happens to run through Chicory on the JVM (`kotoba run`). The exact same
;; bytes, loaded by a browser's or Node's own native WebAssembly engine
;; (kotoba-lang/wasm-webcomponent's actor-host.js / kotoba-wasm-element.js,
;; no Chicory involved at all), previously had NO fuel protection
;; whatsoever -- only the JVM path was ever covered.
;;
;; Two design differences from the compiler.cljc port, both required by
;; things this file's `wasm-binary` docstring already documents as
;; supported that compiler.cljc's simpler single-shot `main()` model does
;; not need to consider:
;;
;;   1. Budget size: compiler.cljc uses 256 (deliberately tiny -- "low
;;      enough to trap before the host call stack becomes the limiting
;;      resource"). This file already has its OWN existing, tested,
;;      independent 256-scale budget for a DIFFERENT purpose
;;      (`primary-collection-fuel` = 128, capping built-in collection
;;      recursion specifically) -- a single legitimate `map`/`filter`/
;;      `reduce` call over an ordinary-sized collection can already cost
;;      close to 128 real function calls on its own, so reusing
;;      compiler.cljc's 256 here would trap ordinary, already-working
;;      collection-processing programs, not just runaway ones. Uses
;;      5,000,000 instead -- the SAME order-of-magnitude default
;;      `kototama.tender`'s (JVM/Chicory) `default-fuel-limit` and this
;;      file's own `kotoba.wasm-exec/fuel-listener` already use
;;      elsewhere in this ecosystem, on the same "generous for legitimate
;;      small guests, still trips a genuinely unbounded loop in a
;;      fraction of a second" reasoning -- proven safe at that scale
;;      already, not a fresh guess.
;;   2. Reset points: compiler.cljc's fuel is a strict, non-replenishable
;;      whole-INSTANCE-lifetime budget (never reset after the module's
;;      globals are initialized) -- correct for its single-shot "compile,
;;      instantiate, call main() once" usage model, where a fresh
;;      Instance is created per invocation anyway. This file's
;;      `wasm-binary` docstring explicitly ALSO supports a second,
;;      long-running usage model: "game modules may expose `init` and/or
;;      `*-tick` systems instead" (see `module-entry?` above) -- a single
;;      Instance whose `*-tick` export the host calls repeatedly, once per
;;      frame, indefinitely. A non-replenishable lifetime budget would
;;      eventually and INCORRECTLY trap such a guest purely for running
;;      long enough, with no runaway behavior at all. So fuel is instead
;;      RESET TO FULL at the entry of `main`, `init`, and any `*-tick`
;;      export specifically (`fuel-reset-entry?` below, reusing this
;;      file's own existing `module-entry?` naming convention rather than
;;      inventing a new one) -- bounding "everything one host-invoked call
;;      does, including however deep its internal recursion goes" without
;;      accumulating fatigue across separate, legitimate, repeated calls.
;;      Every OTHER function (internal, non-entry helpers -- e.g.
;;      `demo_loop_forever.kotoba`'s self-recursive `spin`, which is not
;;      named `main`/`init`/`*-tick`) only decrements, never resets, so
;;      unbounded internal recursion still traps within its enclosing
;;      call exactly as intended.

;; ADR-2607151500: ClojureScript backend -- a SECOND, genuinely separate
;; execution target for `.kotoba`, alongside compile-wasm-expr/wasm-binary
;; above. Covers ONLY the narrow-slice governor-style op set (int/keyword/
;; map literals, let/if/do/and/or/when, pair/pair-first/pair-second, get/
;; assoc, +/-/*/quot//rem/mod/comparisons, not/zero?/pos?/neg?/inc/dec,
;; named function calls) -- explicitly NOT i64/f32 typed ops, bitwise ops,
;; string ops, memory ops (alloc/i32-store!/mem-i32-at/byte-at/etc as raw
;; user-facing ops), or capability ops (cap-acquire/has-capability?/
;; call-indirect). kotoba-lang/compiler's own cljs backend (ADR-2607151500,
;; src/kotoba/compiler/backend/cljs.clj) landed its map/keyword/get/assoc/
;; loop-recur subset first and added cap-call support as a later, separate
;; addendum; the same incremental, honestly-scoped discipline applies here.
;;
;; Unlike compile-wasm-expr, this needs NO `locals`/`fns` context threaded
;; through recursive calls -- WASM locals need numeric INDICES (hence
;; compile-wasm-expr's local-index bookkeeping), but cljs's own `let`/`defn`
;; bind SYMBOLIC names directly, so lowering is a simple form -> form
;; rewrite (mirroring kotoba-lang/compiler's backend/cljs.clj `lower-expr`,
;; which has the same shape for the same reason).
;;
;; Two semantics kotoba's WASM output gets for free from the `if`/
;; comparison WASM OPCODES THEMSELVES (0-is-false via the `if` instruction;
;; i32.eq/i32.lt_s/etc. natively push 0 or 1) that plain cljs forms do NOT
;; reproduce automatically -- both handled explicitly here, same as
;; compiler/'s cljs backend:
;;   - every `if` wraps its test: `(if (zero? test') else' then')`
;;   - every comparison wraps its result: `(if (op ...) 1 0)`
;;
;; `pair`/`pair-first`/`pair-second`: this repo's WASM path encodes a pair
;; as 8 raw bytes in linear memory (alloc + i32-store!/mem-i32-at) because
;; that's the only heap kotoba/'s WASM target has. A cljs runtime already
;; has real persistent data structures, so here a pair is just a plain
;; 2-element vector + `nth` -- simpler, and `get`'s bounded unroll (reused
;; verbatim below, since it's pure form construction that recurses through
;; whichever `compile-*-expr` processes its result) inherits this for free.
;;
;; No memory-based host ABI: `kotoba wasm emit` requires a 0-arity `main`
;; because a WASM module can only export a fixed-arity function and real
;; inputs must be marshaled through linear memory -- neither restriction
;; applies to a cljs target, so `defn`s here keep their own declared
;; params and callers pass real arguments directly. This means EXISTING
;; `.kotoba` sources written for the memory-ABI convention (e.g. the
;; `mem-i32-at`-reading cloud-itonami governor ports) do NOT compile
;; unchanged to this target -- a real, documented v1 scope limit, not
;; silently patched over.
