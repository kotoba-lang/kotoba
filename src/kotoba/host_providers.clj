  "Capability-guarded host provider dispatch for the CLJ runtime slice
  (issue #263).

  Every host-import op from the kotoba core capability contract
  (clipboard_read, http_fetch, fs_read, ...) maps to a
  kotoba.lang.capability-values capability kind (:host/clipboard-read,
  :host/http, :host/fs-read, ...). At run time the launcher builds
  CACAO-style grants and a local policy from its existing policy EDN and
  dispatches each provider invocation through
  kotoba.lang.capability-host/guard-call, so:

  - a denied call NEVER reaches the provider handler (fail closed), and
  - every call — grant, denial, or handler error — leaves a receipt in the
    run's audit journal (surfaced as :kotoba.host/receipts in the launcher
    result).

  Legacy behavior is preserved: a `run` without `--policy` installs no guard
  and host-import ops remain statically rejected as :capability-not-granted,
  exactly as before. Enforcement happens only when a capability policy is
  supplied.

  Policy EDN vocabulary (superset of the existing wasm/provider policy):

  {:kotoba.policy/capabilities #{:clipboard/text :http/fetch ...}
   ;; optional per-capability resource scope (default :any)
   :kotoba.policy/capability-resources {:clipboard/text #{\"clipboard:system\"}}
   ;; optional per-capability grant expiry, enforced at call time
   :kotoba.policy/capability-expires {:clipboard/text \"2027-01-01\"}}

  The default handlers are deterministic Rust-free stubs (the interpreter
  slice has no real memory ABI); concrete native providers (pbcopy/pbpaste,
  an HTTP client, ...) plug in by passing a :handlers map to `host-call`."
