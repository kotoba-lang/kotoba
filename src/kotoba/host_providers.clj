  "Capability-guarded host provider dispatch for the CLJ runtime slice
  (issue #263).

  Every host-import op from the kotoba core capability contract
  (clipboard_read, http_fetch, fs_read, ...) maps to a
  kotoba.lang.capability-values capability kind (:host/clipboard-read,
  :host/http, :host/fs-read, ...). At run time the launcher builds
  CACAO-style grants and a local policy from its existing policy EDN and
  dispatches each provider invocation through
  kotoba.lang.capability-host/guard-call, so:

  - a denied call NEVER reaches the provider handler (fail closed), and
  - every call — grant, denial, or handler error — leaves a receipt in the
    run's audit journal (surfaced as :kotoba.host/receipts in the launcher
    result).

  Legacy behavior is preserved: a `run` without `--policy` installs no guard
  and host-import ops remain statically rejected as :capability-not-granted,
  exactly as before. Enforcement happens only when a capability policy is
  supplied.

  Policy EDN vocabulary (superset of the existing wasm/provider policy):

  {:kotoba.policy/capabilities #{:clipboard/text :http/fetch ...}
   ;; optional per-capability resource scope (default :any)
   :kotoba.policy/capability-resources {:clipboard/text #{\"clipboard:system\"}}
   ;; optional per-capability grant expiry, enforced at call time
   :kotoba.policy/capability-expires {:clipboard/text \"2027-01-01\"}}

  The default handlers are deterministic Rust-free stubs (the interpreter
  slice has no real memory ABI); concrete native providers (pbcopy/pbpaste,
  an HTTP client, ...) plug in by passing a :handlers map to `host-call`."

  kotoba.lang.capability-values/intersect-grants (run by guard-call, inside

  a host KIND -- the guest's actual path argument isn't known until AFTER
  the guard decision runs, so a policy that scopes `:fs/app-data` to
  specific paths (`:kotoba.policy/capability-resources`) would otherwise be
  silently ignored once the capability kind is granted at all. This extra,
  per-call check is what actually enforces that narrowing; it mirrors
  kotoba.wasm-exec's `resource-permitted?` (identical policy vocabulary:
  `:any`, a bare resource string, or a set of them) -- duplicated rather
  than shared because kotoba.wasm-exec already requires this namespace, so
  the reverse require would be circular. Comparison is on the canonicalized
  path so a granted resource string can't be trivially defeated by a
  `./`-prefixed or symlinked spelling of the same file.

  kbb slice 2 (ADR-2607181900): a scope entry that names a DIRECTORY also
  admits the files strictly beneath it (prefix boundary on a path
  separator, same rule as `fs-dir-permitted?`). This keeps the kbb verify
  gate's grant shape uniform — one granted directory covers
  fs-browse(dir) + fs-read(dir/file) — while a per-FILE scope entry keeps

  really reads a file's bytes off disk (as a UTF-8 string) and fs-write

  values (a path string, file content), NOT the (ptr,len) WASM-ABI shape --
  see `kgraph-handlers`' docstring for why the CLJ interpreter slice uses
  this convention (it has no linear memory to marshal a ptr/len pair
  through). host-i64-roundtrip echoes its argument (matching the
  interpreter builtin); the remaining pointer-ABI providers return 0 (the
  success status of the provider result ABI) since the interpreter has no
  real memory to read a ptr/len pair out of — `str-ptr` always evaluates to
  0 here (kotoba.runtime/builtin-fns). Real native providers for those (or,
  for kgraph-*, `kgraph-handlers` below / kotoba.wasm-exec's Chicory host
  functions for genuine WASM execution, which ALREADY has real fs-read/
  fs-write/http-fetch/clipboard/keychain/etc. behind a sandboxed fs-root —

  match the op (kotoba.cap-table/resolve-use). Provider handlers are looked
  up by the BASE op — a `<op>-with` call reaches the same provider as `<op>`,
  only the authorization path differs. Every use — grant, denial (unknown
  handle, kind mismatch, expiry), or handler error — leaves a receipt
  carrying :receipt/cap-handle; :receipt/call is the `<op>-with` surface.
