  "Regression coverage for ADR-2607150000's kotoba-lang/kotoba language
  extensions: keyword literals, map literals, pair/pair-first/pair-second,
  and get/assoc -- ported (in spirit) from kotoba-lang/compiler's version of
  the same feature, but implemented on top of THIS repo's own existing
  alloc/i32-store!/mem-i32-at primitives (kotoba/, unlike compiler/, already
  exposes raw linear memory to guest code directly, so no host import was
  needed here either).

  Proves, through the SAME real compile -> emit -> Chicory-execute path
  `kotoba.wasm-exec-test`/`kotoba.wasm-and-or-when-test` use elsewhere in
  this suite, that the emitted WASM is genuinely executable, not merely
  byte-structure-valid."
