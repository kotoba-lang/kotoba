(ns kotoba.guest-grammar-vendor-test
  "Every copy of kotoba-lang's `lang/guest-grammar.edn` on this classpath is
  the authority's bytes, and the authority is named by digest.

  ## What this adds to the check next door

  `kotoba.security-kaizen-test/every-guest-grammar-on-the-classpath-is-the-same-bytes`
  requires every copy of `kotoba/lang/guest-grammar.edn` here to be
  byte-identical, with no exemption. That is the right check and this file does
  not repeat or weaken it. What agreeing with each OTHER cannot tell you is
  whether they agree with the AUTHORITY: measured 2026-09-03 all five copies --
  `resources/`, `vendor/grammar/resources/`, and one each from the pinned amu,
  kotoba-lang and kotoba-sema -- agreed with each other while being one wave
  behind kotoba-lang, and this file was written to record that gap as a number.

  ## The 112-head gap is closed; the one-head gap behind it is closed too

  Closing it was the one change the earlier version of this namespace said it
  would be: advance the amu pin (and with it kotoba-lang and kotoba-sema),
  resync BOTH copies this repository ships, in one commit. Done 2026-09-03 at
  authority `67561e57`. **While that change was open, the authority moved
  again** (kotoba-lang added `kernel-uefi-alloc-region`, taking the authority
  to `6e1202fd` / 115 kernel heads), which reopened a one-head gap recorded
  here as two literals.

  Closed for good 2026-09-04: both copies, the amu / kotoba-lang / kotoba-sema
  pins and the `ci.yml` authority checkout moved together to kotoba-lang
  dd8bcb62 (`871f3873...`), so the classpath IS the authority and there is one
  kernel-head count, not two. `authority-grammar-sha256` and
  `authority-kernel-head-count` are gone, as the test itself prescribed for
  exactly this state. What keeps the gap closed from here:
  `every-guest-grammar-on-the-classpath-is-the-same-bytes` (byte-identity of
  every copy), this file's digest pin, and the digest pins the other three
  repositories carry.

  ## What the gap costs, for the record

  `kotoba.grammar/admitted-heads` unions `:admitted-builtins` into the
  known-head set `strict-problems` checks a guest program against, and nothing
  in kotoba-lang, kotoba-sema or amu reads that key at all. While the copies
  were at `e20f3e50`, `:admitted-builtins` named THREE kernel heads where the
  frontend admits 114, so 111 heads the compiler admits were reported here as
  `:unknown-form`. It names 115 now."
