  "Regression coverage for `kotoba.runtime/read-forms`/`read-file`'s reader
  safety: `.kotoba` source is untrusted input (the whole point of the
  safe-subset checker downstream), so the reader itself must never be able
  to execute code -- `clojure.tools.reader/*read-eval*` defaults to true,
  which lets `#=(...)` run arbitrary JVM code at READ time, before the
  checker or any capability policy ever runs.

  Also covers `kotoba.runtime/run`'s interpreter-path resource-exhaustion
  handling (unbounded recursion -> StackOverflowError)."

(deftest interpreter-run-catches-stack-overflow-from-unbounded-recursion
  (testing "the interpreter (eval-form/eval-body/call-fn) is a plain
            tree-walker with no tail-call optimization and no fuel/step
            budget of its own (unlike the WASM path's
            kotoba.wasm-exec/fuel-listener, a real per-instruction cap).
            src/demo_loop_forever.kotoba's `spin` (already used by
            kotoba.wasm-exec-test's fuel-limit-traps-a-genuinely-unbounded-
            guest for the WASM path) calls itself with no base case, so
            running it through the interpreter grows the JVM call stack
            until StackOverflowError -- a java.lang.Error, NOT a
            clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo, so `run`'s existing
            (catch clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo ...) does not see it. Before
            this fix, that StackOverflowError propagated all the way out of
            `run` uncaught, crashing the process with a raw Java stack
            trace instead of returning the clean :kotoba.runtime/ok? false
            shape every other run failure mode already uses. This test
            itself is proof the fix works: if the catch clause were
            missing, this test process would die with an uncaught
            StackOverflowError instead of the assertions below running at
            all."
