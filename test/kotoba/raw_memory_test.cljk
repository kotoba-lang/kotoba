  "T1 memory safety: raw linear-memory dereference is denied in user source.

  The property under test is that a `.kotoba` module cannot read or write an
  arbitrary address in its own linear memory, because that is what lets a
  guest forge the language's own values -- pair handles, string (ptr,len)
  headers, container internals -- none of which Wasm's module-level sandbox
  protects. ADR-safe-capability-language.md has claimed this gate since the
  Rust tree; these tests are the first ones that hold the CURRENT
  implementation to it."
