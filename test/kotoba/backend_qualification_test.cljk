  would pin a refusal the language has deliberately given up.

  WHAT CHANGED. kotoba-lang landed local-state slice 1 (kotoba-sema 60341cc5,
  kotoba-lang 95bc01ae; superproject ADR
  adr-2609021600-kotoba-unison-deepening-five-priorities, section 6). A
  function-local, non-escaping atom is admitted and elaborated away by source
  state passing: the cell becomes an ordinary let rebinding, so there is no
  host, no grant, and nothing at runtime.

  WHY THAT IS NOT A WEAKENING OF THE INVARIANT. The invariant `:no-ambient-
  mutation` protects is that state must not be AMBIENT, not that mutation is
  forbidden. A cell that cannot leave the body that binds it is not ambient.
  What this test pins instead is the boundary that actually still holds:

    1. an ESCAPING atom is still refused, by the exact landed message;
    2. the other mutation heads are still in :forbidden-heads, refused by the
       exact ambient-forbidden message;
    3. the legacy `kotoba wasm emit` emitter still refuses `atom` outright, so
       widening on one backend is not read as widening everywhere;
    4. the widened program's VALUE is pinned, so the widening cannot silently
       change meaning either.

  This is deliberately a stronger test than the one it replaces: the case it
  replaces asserted one refusal, this asserts one admitted value plus nine
  refusals pinned by message."}
