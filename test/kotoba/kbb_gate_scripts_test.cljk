(ns kotoba.kbb-gate-scripts-test
  "Tests for the kbb gate-script wave 2 (ADR-2607181900 condition 2):
  representative single-directory scan slices of the superproject's
  production nbb gate scripts, ported to run entirely on kbb.

    src/no_bb_scan.kotoba     verify-no-babashka residue scan over MULTIPLE
                              policy-granted directories (verify_no_bb's
                              directory-argument generalization)
    src/shebang_scan.kotoba   shebang classifier (verify-no-babashka's
                              shebang arm, per-class breakdown)

  Each test runs the real .kotoba source through kotoba.kbb/dispatch (the
  same path the kbb CLI binary uses) and asserts the exact value against a
  real fixture directory (no symlinks). Policies are deny-by-default with
  concrete per-directory resource scopes and forbid-wildcard true."
